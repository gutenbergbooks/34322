Based on real people (ca. 1620) – THE MOGHUL begins in a rip-roaring sea battle
north of Bombay in which the vastly out-gunned adventurer, Brian Hawksworth,
ship's captain and emissary of King James, blows away a flotilla of Portuguese
galleons to gain access to an Indian port. He's come to open trade for
“barbaric” </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>England</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'> and squeeze out the Portuguese, who
try to kill him at every turn. But once on land, he’s captive: the beauty and
romance of the exquisite Moghul Empire seduce him from his material goals to a
new quest – of supreme sensuality in music, visions, and sacred lovemaking. <br>
<br>
</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>India</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>, ruled by the son of great Akbar,
is about to pass to one of his sons. Hawksworth must choose sides, but will he
choose right? The future of </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
  Arial'>England</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>, and
of </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>India</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>, depend on it. Assailed by intrigue
and assassination, tormented by a forbidden love, enthralled by a mystic poet,
Hawksworth engages war elephants, tiger hunts, the harem of the Red Fort of
Agra, the Rajput warriors at Udaipur, becomes intimate champion to Shah Jahan,
(builder of the Taj Mahal), and, in his supreme test, plays the sitar with a
touch that elicits from the great Shah – “Finally, my English friend – you
understand.”<br>
<br>
THE MOGHUL was immediately a European bestseller, optioned by Indian producers
who commissioned a six-hour mini-series, then Canadian producers with the BBC. </span></p>

<h1><a name=bookmark1>AUTHOR‘S NOTE</a></h1>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>This tale is
offered to the memory of one William Hawkins (1575-1613), a brandy-drinking,
Turkish-speaking seaman and adventurer who was the first Englishman to reach
the court of Jahangir, the Great Moghul of India. There he delivered gifts from
the new East India Company and a letter from King James proposing direct trade,
then a zealously protected monopoly of </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>Portugal</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>.
As he gradually adopted Indian ways, Hawkins became a court favorite of the
Moghul, who made him a knightly <i>khan </i>and eventually tried to keep him in
</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>India</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>. After several Portuguese-instigated
attempts to murder him, Hawkins attached himself for safety to a certain
willful Indian woman. The end of their story eventually became a minor legend
throughout the early East India Company.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>As astonishing as some of the elements in the
historical landscape described here may seem today, they are all by and large
fictional re-creations of actual events, practices, people—drawn from diaries
of seventeenth-century European travelers and from Indian historical materials.
Aside from the names, only the clocks in this remote world have been knowingly
altered. Years in historical time have become months in these pages, months have
become days. Several vicious naval engagements between English frigates and
Portuguese galleons, several major land battles between Indian armies, have

color:windowtext'>He watched from the quarterdeck as the chain fed through the
whitecaps of the bay, its staccato clatter muffled, hollow in the </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>midday</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'> heat. Then he sensed the anchor grab and felt an uneasy
tremor pass along the hull as the links snapped taut against the tide. The
cannon were already run in and cooling, but vagrant threads of smoke still
traced skyward through the scuttles and open hatch, curling ringlets over two
draped bodies by the mainmast. Along the main deck scurvy-blotched seamen,
haggard and shirtless to the sun, eased the wounded toward the shade of the
fo'c'sle.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He drew the last swallow of brandy from his hooped wooden
tankard and instinctively shifted his gaze aloft, squinting against the midday
sun to watch as two bosun's mates edged along the yards to furl the mainsail.
Then he turned to inspect the triangular lateen sail behind him, parted into
shreds by the first Portuguese cannon salvo, its canvas now strewn among the
mizzenmast shrouds.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>A round of cheers told him the last two casks of salt pork
had finally emerged from the smoky hold, and he moved to the railing to watch
as they were rolled toward the cauldron boiling on deck. As he surveyed the faces
of the gathering men, he asked himself how many could still chew the briny meat
he had hoarded so carefully for this final morning of the voyage.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The crowd parted as he moved down the companionway steps and
onto the deck. He was tall, with lines of fatigue etched down his angular face
and smoke residue laced through his unkempt hair and short beard. His doublet
was plain canvas, and his breeches and boots scarcely differed from those of a
common seaman. His only adornment was a small gold ring in his left ear. Today
he also wore a bloodstained binding around his thigh, where a musket shot from
a Portuguese maintop had furrowed the skin.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He was Brian Hawksworth, captain of the five-hundred-ton
English frigate <i>Discovery </i>and Captain-General of the Third Voyage of
England's new East India Company. His commission, assigned in London over seven
months past, was to take two armed trading frigates around the Cape of Good
Hope, up the eastern coast of Africa, and then through the Arabian Sea to the
northwest coast of India. The Company had twice before sailed eastward from the
</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Cape</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>, to the equatorial islands of the </span><span
 style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Indies</span><span style='font-size:

for </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>India</span><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The destination of this, the first English voyage to
challenge </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Lisbon</span><span

  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Tapti</span><span style='font-size:
 10.0pt;color:windowtext'> </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>River</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>, largest of the only two harbors on
the Indian subcontinent not controlled by </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>Portugal</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He reached for the second tankard of brandy that had been
brought and squinted again toward the mouth of the Tapti, where four armed
Portuguese galleons had been anchored earlier that morning.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Damn the Company. No one planned on galleons at the river
mouth. Not now, not this early in the season. Did the </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Portugals</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> somehow learn our destination? . . .
And if they knew that, do they know the rest of the Company's plan?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Since the Tapti had been badly silted for decades, navigable
only by cargo barge or small craft, he and the merchants must travel upriver to
</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Surat</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> by pinnace, the twenty-foot sailboat
lashed amidships on the <i>Discovery</i>'s main deck. There the merchants would
try to negotiate </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>England</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>'s first direct trade with </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>India</span><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;color:windowtext'>. And Brian Hawksworth would undertake a separate
mission, one the East India Company hoped might someday change the course of
trade throughout the </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Indies</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He remounted the steps to the quarterdeck and paused to study
the green shoreline circling their inlet. The low-lying hills undulated in the
sun's heat, washing the <i>Discovery </i>in the dense perfume of land. Already </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>India</span><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;color:windowtext'> beckoned, the lure even stronger than all the legends
told. He smiled to himself and drank again, this time a toast to the first
English captain ever to hoist colors off the coast of </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>India</span><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;color:windowtext'>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then with a weary hand he reached for the telescope, an
expensive new Dutch invention, and trained it on his second frigate, the <i>Resolve</i>,
anchored a musket shot away. Like the <i>Discovery</i>, she rode easily at
anchor, bearing to lee. He noted with relief that her ship's carpenter had
finally sealed a patch of oakum and sail in the gash along her portside bow.
For a few hours now, the men on the pumps could retire from the sweltering
hold.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Finally, he directed the glass toward the remains of two
Portuguese galleons aground in the sandy shallows off his starboard quarter,
black smoke still streaming from gaps in their planking where explosions had
ripped through the hull. And for an instant his stomach tightened, just as it
had earlier that morning, when one of those same galleons had laid deep shadows
across the <i>Discovery's </i>decks, so close he could almost read the eyes of
the infantry poised with grapples to swing down and board. The </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Portugals</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> will be back, he told himself, and
soon. With fireships.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>He scanned the river mouth once more. It was
deserted now. Even the fishing craft had fled. But upriver would be another
matter. Portuguese longboats, launched with boarding parties of infantry, had
been stranded when the two galleons were lost. Together they had carried easily
a hundred, perhaps two hundred musketmen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>They made for the Tapti, he thought grimly, and they'll be
upriver waiting. We have to launch before they can set a blockade. Tonight. On
the tide.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He revolved to find Giles Mackintosh, quartermaster of the <i>Discovery</i>,
waiting mutely by his side.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Mackintosh, start outfitting the pinnace. We launch at
sunset, before the last dog watch.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The quartermaster pulled at his matted red curls in silence
as he studied the tree-lined river mouth. Then he turned abruptly to
Hawksworth. &quot;Takin' the pinnace upriver'll be a death sentence, Cap'n, I
warrant you. </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Portugals</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>'ll be layin' for us, thicker'n
whores at a Tyburn hangin'.&quot; He paused deliberately and knotted the string
holding back hair from his smoke-darkened cheeks. &quot;I say we weigh at the
tide and ease the frigates straight up their hell-bound river. She's wide as
the </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Thames</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> at Woolwich. We'll run out the guns
and hand the pox-rotted Papists another taste o' English courtesy.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Can you navigate the sandbars?&quot; </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'> &quot;I've seen nae sign of bars.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The Indian pilot we took on yesterday claims there's
shallows upriver.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;All the more reason to sail. By my thinkin' the pilot's
a full-bred Moor. An' they're all the same, Indian or Turk.&quot; Mackintosh
blew his nose over the railing, punctuating his disgust. &quot;Show me one
that's na a liar, a thief, or a damned Sodomite. Nae honest Christian'll credit
the word of a Moor.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;There's risk either way.&quot; Hawksworth drew slowly
on the brandy, appearing to weigh the Scotsman's views. &quot;But there's the
cargo to think of. Taken for all, it's got to be the pinnace. And this Moorish
pilot's not like the Turks. I should know.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Aye, Cap'n, as you will.&quot; Mackintosh nodded with
seeming reluctance, admiring how Hawksworth had retained mastery of their old
game. Even after two years apart. &quot;But I'll be watchin' the bastard, e'ery
move he makes.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth turned and slowly descended the quarterdeck steps.
As he entered the passageway leading aft to the Great Cabin and the merchants'
cabins, he saw the silhouette of George Elkington. The Chief Merchant of the
voyage was standing by the quarter gallery railing, drawing on a long clay pipe
as he urinated into the swells. When he spotted Hawksworth, he whirled and
marched heavily down the corridor, perfunctorily securing the single remaining
button of his breeches.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Elkington's once-pink jowls were slack and pasty, and his
grease-stained doublet sagged over what had been, seven months past, a
luxuriant belly. Sweat trickled down from the sides of his large hat, streaming
oily rivulets across his cheeks.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Hawksworth, did I hear you order the pinnace launch'd
tonight? E'en before we've made safe anchorage for the cargo?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The sooner the better. The </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Portugals</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> know we'll have to go upriver. By
tomorrow they'll be ready.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Your first obligation, sirrah, is the goods. Every
shilling the Company subscrib'd is cargo'd in these two damn'd merchantmen. A
fine fortune in wool broadcloth, </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
 color:windowtext'>Devonshire</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>
kersey, pig iron, tin, quicksilver. I've a good ten thousand pound of my own
accounts invest'd. And you'd leave it all hove to in this piss crock of a bay,
whilst the Portugals are doubtless crewin' up a dozen two-deckers down the
coast in Goa. ‘Tis sure they'll be laid full about this anchorage inside a
fortnight.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth inspected Elkington with loathing, musing what he
disliked about him most—his grating voice, or his small lifeless eyes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>And what you probably don't realize is they'll be back next
time with trained gunners. Not like today, when their gun crews clearly were </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Lisbon</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> dockside rabble, private traders
who'd earned passage out to the </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
 color:windowtext'>Indies</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>
on the easy claim they were gunners, half not knowing a linstock from a
lamppost.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Elkington, I'll tell you as much of our plans as befits
you</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>r place</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>.&quot; Hawksworth moved past him
toward the door of the Great Cabin. &quot;We're taking the pinnace upriver
tonight on the tide. And you'll be in it, along with your coxcomb clerk.
Captain Kerridge of the <i>Resolve</i> will take command of the ships. I've
already prepared orders to move both frigates to a new anchorage.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I demand to know what damn'd fool scheme you've
hatch'd.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;There's no reason you have to know. Right now the fewer
who know the better, particularly the men going upriver.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, I know this much, Hawksworth. This voyage to </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>India</span><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;color:windowtext'> may well be the East India Company's last chance to
trade in the </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Indies</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>. If we fail three voyages in a row,
we'd as well close down the Company and just buy pepper and spice outright from
the damn'd Hollanders. </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>England</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>'s got no goods that'll trade in the </span><span
 style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Spice Islands</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> south o' here. Remember </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Lancaster</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> cargo'd wool down to the islands on
the first two Company voyages, thinkin' to swap it for pepper, and discover'd
for himself what I'd guess'd all along—a tribe of heathens sweatin' in the sun
have no call for woolen breeches. So either we trade up here in the north, where
they'll take wool, or we're finish'd.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The anchorage I've found should keep the cargo—and the
men—safe till we make </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Surat</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>. With luck you'll have your cargo
aland before the </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Portugals</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> locate us.&quot; Hawksworth pushed
open the heavy oak door of the Great Cabin and entered, stranding Elkington in
the passageway. &quot;And now I wish you good day.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The cabin's dark overhead beams were musty from the heat and
its air still dense with smoke from the cannon. The stern windows were partly
blocked now by the two bronze demi-culverin that had been run out aft,
&quot;stern-chaser&quot; cannon that could spit a nine-pound ball with deadly
accuracy—their lighter bronze permitting longer barrels than those of the
cast-iron guns below decks. He strode directly to the oil lantern swaying over
the great center desk and turned up the wick. The cabin brightened slightly,
but the face of the English lute wedged in the corner seemed suddenly to come
alive, shining gold over the cramped quarters like a full moon. He stared at it
wistfully for a moment, then shook his head and settled himself behind the
large oak desk. And asked himself once more why he had ever agreed to the
voyage.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>To prove something? To the Company? To himself?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He reflected again on how it had come about, and why he had
finally accepted the Company's offer. . . . </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It had been a dull morning in late October, the kind of day
when all </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>London</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> seems trapped in an icy gloom
creeping up from the </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Thames</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>. His weekly lodgings were frigid as
always, and his mind was still numb from the previous night's tavern brandy.
Back from </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Tunis</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> scarcely a month, he already had
nothing left to pawn. Two years before, he had been leading a convoy of
merchantmen through the </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Mediterranean</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> when their ships and cargo were
seized by Turkish corsairs, galleys owned by the notorious <i>dey </i>of </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Tunis</span><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;color:windowtext'>. He had finally managed to get back to </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>London</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>, but now he was a captain without a
ship. In years past this might have been small matter to remedy. But no longer.
</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>England</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>, he discovered, had changed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The change was apparent mainly to seamen. The lower house of
Parliament was still preoccupied fighting King James's new proposal that
Scotland be joined to England, viewed by most Englishmen as a sufferance of
proud beggars and ruffians upon a nation of uniformly upright taxpayers; in
London idle crowds still swarmed the bear gardens to wager on the huge mastiffs
pitted against the chained bears; rioting tenant farmers continued to outrage
propertied men by tearing down enclosures and grazing their flocks on the
gentry's private hunting estates; and the new Puritans increasingly harassed
everyone they disapproved of, from clerics who wore vestments to women who wore
cosmetics to children who would play ball on Sunday.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Around London more talk turned on which handsome young
courtier was the latest favorite of their effeminate new king than on His
Majesty's enforcement of his new and strict decree forbidding privateering—the
staple occupation of England seamen for the last three decades of Elizabeth's
reign. King James had cravenly signed a treaty of peace with </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Spain</span><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;color:windowtext'>, and by that act brought ruin to half a hundred
thousand English &quot;sea dogs.&quot; They awoke to discover their historic
livelihood, legally plundering the shipping of </span><span style='font-size:
  10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Spain</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'> and </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Portugal</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> under wartime letters of marque, had
become a criminal offense.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>For a captain without a ship, another commission by a trading
company seemed out of the question, and especially now, with experienced seamen
standing idle the length of </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>London</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>. Worst of all, the woman he had
hoped to return to, red-haired Maggie Tyne of Billingsgate, had disappeared
from her old lodgings and haunts leaving no trace. Rumor had her married—some
said to the master of a </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Newcastle</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> coal barge, others to a gentleman. </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>London</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> seemed empty now, and he passed the
vacant days with brandy and his lute, and thoughts of quitting the sea—to do he
knew not what.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then in that cold early dawn appeared the letter, requesting
his immediate appearance at the Director's Office of the East India Company,
should this coincide with his convenience. He found its tone ominous. Was some
merchant planning to have him jailed for his loss of cargo to the Turks? But
he'd been sailing for the Levant Company, not the East India Company. He
debated with himself all morning, and finally decided to go. And face the
mercantile bastards.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The new offices of the Company already seemed embalmed in the
smell of lamp oil and sweat, their freshly painted wood timbers masked in dull
soot. A stale odor of ink, paper, and arid commerce assailed his senses as he
was announced and ushered through the heavy oak door of the Director's suite.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>And he was astonished by what awaited. Standing hard by the
Director's desk—was Maggie. He'd searched the length of </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>London</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> in vain for her, and here she was.
But he almost didn't recognize her. Their two years apart had brought a change
beyond anything he could have imagined.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>No one would have guessed what she once had been, a dockside
girl happiest at the Southwark bear-gardens, or in a goose-down bed. And
somehow she had always managed to turn a shilling at both—wagering with a
practiced eye on the snarling dogs brought in to bloody the bears, or taking
her pleasure only after deftly extracting some loan, to allay an urgent need
she inevitably remembered the moment she entered his lodgings.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>That morning, however, she reigned like an exotic
flower, flourishing amid the mercantile gloom. She was dressed and painted in
the very latest upper-class style—her red hair now bleached deep yellow,
sprinkled thick with gold dust, and buried under a feathered hat; her
crushed-velvet bodice low-necked, cut fashionably just below the nipples, then
tied at the neck with a silk lace ruff; her once-ruddy breasts now painted
pale, with blue veins penciled in; and her face carefully powdered lead-white, save
the red dye on her lips and cheeks and the glued-on beauty patches of stars and
half-moons. His dockside girl had become a completely modern lady of fashion.
He watched in disbelief as she curtsied to him, awkwardly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then he noticed Sir Randolph Spencer, Director of the
Company.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Captain Hawksworth. So you're the man we've heard so
much about? Understand you escaped from </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>Tunis</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>
under the very nose of the damned Turks.&quot; He extended a manicured hand
while he braced himself on the silver knob of his cane. Although Spencer's
flowing hair was pure white, his face still clung tenuously to youth. His
doublet was expensive, and in the new longer waist-length style Hawksworth
remembered seeing on young men-about-town. &quot;'Tis indeed a pleasure. Nay,
'tis an honor.&quot; The tone was practiced and polite, a transparent attempt
at sincerity rendered difficult by Hawksworth's ragged appearance. He had
listened to Spencer mutely, suddenly realizing his loss of cargo had been
forgotten. He was being congratulated for coming back alive.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;'Twas the wife, Margaret here, set me thinkin' about
you. Says you two were lightly acquainted in younger years. Pity I never knew
her then myself.&quot; Spencer motioned him toward a carved wooden chair facing
the desk. &quot;She ask'd to be here today to help me welcome you. Uncommonly
winsome lady, what say?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth looked at Maggie's gloating eyes and felt his
heart turn. It was obvious enough she'd found her price. At last she had what
she'd always really wanted, a rich widower. But why trouble to flaunt it?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He suspected he already knew. She simply couldn't resist.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Now I pride myself on being a sound judge of humanity,
Hawksworth, and I've made sufficient inquiry to know you can work a ship with
the best. So I'll come right to it. I suppose 'tis common talk the Company's
dispatchin' another voyage down to the </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
 color:windowtext'>Indies</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>
this comin' spring. Soon as our new frigate, the <i>Discovery</i>, is out of
the yard. And this time our first port of call's to be </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>India</span><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;color:windowtext'>.&quot; Spencer caught Hawksworth's look, without
realizing it was directed past him, at Maggie. &quot;Aye, I know. We all know.
The damned </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Portugals</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>'ve been there a hundred year, thick
as flies on pudding. But by Jesus we've no choice but to try openin' </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>India</span><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;color:windowtext'> to English trade.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Spencer had paused and examined Hawksworth skeptically. A
process of sizing up seemed underway, of pondering whether this shipless
captain with the bloodshot eyes and gold earring was really the man. He looked
down and inspected his manicured nails for a long moment, then continued.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Now what I'm about to tell you mustn't go past this
room. But first let me ask you, Is everything I've heard about you true? 'Tis
said the <i>dey </i>of </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Tunis</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> held you there after he took your
merchantmen, in hopes you'd teach his damned Turks how to use the English
cannon you had on board.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;He's started building sailing bottoms now, thinking
he'll replace the galleys his Turkish pirates have used for so long. His
shipwrights are some English privateers who've relocated in </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Tunis</span><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;color:windowtext'> to escape prison here. And he was planning to outfit
his new sailing ships with my cannon. He claims English cast-iron culverin are
the best in the world.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;God damn the Barbary Turks. And the Englishmen who've
started helping them.&quot; Spencer bristled. &quot;Next thing and they'll be
out past </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Gibraltar</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>, pillaging our shipping right up the
</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Thames</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>. But I understand you revised his
plans.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The Turks don't have any more cannon now than they had
two years ago. When I refused to help them, they put me in prison, under guard.
But one night I managed to knife two of the guards and slip down to the yard. I
worked till dawn and had the guns spiked before anybody realized I was
gone.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And I hear you next stole a single-masted shallop and
sail'd the length of the </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Barbary
 coast</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> alone, right up
to </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Gibraltar</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>, where you hailed an English
merchantman?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Didn't seem much point in staying on after that.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You're the man all right. Now, 'tis said you learn'd
the language of the Turks while you were in </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>Tunis</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>.
Well, sirrah, answer me now, can you speak it or no?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;For two years I scarcely heard a word of English. But
what's that to do with trade in </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>India</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>?
From what I know, you'll need a few merchants who speak Portuguese. And plenty
of English . . .&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Hear me out, sir. If all I wanted was to anchor a cargo
of English goods and pull off some trade for a season, I'd not be</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>needin' a
man like you. But let me tell you a thing or so about </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>India</span><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;color:windowtext'>. The rulers there now are named Moghuls. They used to
be called Mongols, Turkish-Afghans from </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
 color:windowtext'>Turkistan</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>,
before they took over </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>India</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> about a hundred years back, and
their king, the one they call the Great Moghul, still speaks some Turki, the
language of the Central Asian steppes. Now I'm told this Turki bears fair
resemblance to the language of the damned Turks in the </span><span
 style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Mediterranean</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>.&quot; Spencer assumed a
conspiratorial smile. &quot;I've a plan in mind, but it needs a man who speaks
this Great Moghul’s language.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth suddenly realized Maggie must have somehow
convinced Spencer he was the only seaman in </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>England</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>
who knew Turkish. It could scarcely be true.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Now I ask you, Hawksworth, what's the purpose of the
East India Company? Well, 'tis to trade wool for pepper and spice, simple as
that. To find a market for English commodity, mainly wool. And to ship home
with cheap pepper. Now we can buy all the pepper we like down in Java and </span><span
 style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Sumatra</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>, but they'll not take wool in trade.
And if we keep on buying there with gold, there'll never be a farthing's profit
in our voyages to the </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Indies</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>. By the same token, we're sure these
Moghuls in </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>North India</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> will take wool. They already buy it
from the damned </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Portugals</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>. But they don't grow pepper.&quot;
Spencer leaned forward and his look darkened slightly. &quot;The hard fact is
the East India Company's not done nearly as well as our subscribers hoped. But
now the idea's come along—I hate to admit 'twas George Elkington first thought
of it—that we try swappin' wool for the cotton goods they produce in North
India, then ship these south and trade for pepper and spice. Indian traders
have sold their cotton calicoes in the </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
 color:windowtext'>Spice Islands</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'> for years. Do you follow the strategy?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Spencer had scrutinized Hawksworth for a moment, puzzling at
his flash of anger when Elkington's name was mentioned, then pressed forward.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Overall not a bad idea, considerin' it came from
Elkington.&quot; Then Spencer dropped his voice to just above a whisper.
&quot;But what he doesn't understand is if we're goin' to start tradin' in </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>India</span><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;color:windowtext'>, we'll need a real treaty, like the Hollanders have
down in some of the islands. Because once you've got a treaty, you can settle a
permanent trading station, what we call a 'factory,' and bargain year round.
Buy when prices are best.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth sensed the interview would not be short, and he
settled uneasily into the chair. Maggie still stood erect and formal, affecting
a dignity more studied than natural. As Spencer warmed to his subject he seemed
to have forgotten her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Now, sir, once we have a factory we can start sending
in a few cannon—to 'protect our merchants,' like the Hollanders do in the
islands—and soon enough we've got the locals edgy. Handle it right and pretty
soon they'll sign over exclusive trade. No more competition.&quot; Spencer
smiled again in private satisfaction. &quot;Are you startin' to follow my
thinkin'?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What you've described is the very arrangement the </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Portugals</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> have in </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>India</span><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;color:windowtext'> now.&quot; Hawksworth tried to appear attentive, but
he couldn't keep his eyes off Maggie, who stood behind Spencer wearing a
triumphant smile. &quot;And they've got plenty of cannon and sail to make sure
their trade's exclusive.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We know all about the </span><span style='font-size:
  10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Portugals</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>' fleet of warships, and their shipyards in </span><span
 style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Goa</span><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;color:windowtext'>, and all the rest. But these things always take time.
Took the </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Portugals</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> many a year to get their hooks into </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>India</span><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;color:windowtext'>'s ports. But their days are numbered there,
Hawksworth. The whole Eastern empire of the </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>Portugals</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>
is rotten. I can almost smell it. But if we dally about, the damned Hollanders
are sure to move in.&quot; Spencer had become increasingly excited, and
Hawksworth watched as he began pacing about the room.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, if you're saying you want a treaty, why not just
send an ambassador to the Great Moghul’s court?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Damn me, Hawksworth, it's not that easy. We send some
dandified gentry who doesn't know the language, and he'll end up havin' to do
all his talkin' through court interpreters. And who might they be? Well let me
just show you, sirrah.&quot; Spencer began to shuffle impatiently through the
papers on his desk. &quot;They're Jesuits. Damned Jesuits. Papists straight out
o' </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Lisbon</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>. We know for a fact they do all the
translatin' for the court in </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Agra</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>.&quot; He paused as he rummaged the
stacks in front of him. &quot;We've just got hold of some Jesuit letters. Sent
out from the Moghul capital at </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Agra</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>, through </span><span
 style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Goa</span><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;color:windowtext'>, intended for Lison. They'll tell you plain enough
what the Company's up against.&quot; His search became increasingly frenetic.
&quot;Damn me, they were here.&quot; He rose and shuffled toward the door,
waving his cane in nervous agitation. &quot;Hold a minute.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth had watched him disappear through the doorway,
then looked back to see Maggie laughing. She retrieved a leather-bound packet
from the mantel and tossed it carelessly onto the desk. He found himself
watching her in admiration, realizing some things never change.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What the hell's this about?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She smiled and her voice was like always. &quot;Methinks 'tis
plain enough.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You want me gone from </span><span style='font-size:
  10.0pt;color:windowtext'>London</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'> this badly?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;He takes care o' me. At least he loves me. Something
you were ne'er capable of.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And what were you capable of? All you wanted was . .
.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I . . .&quot; She looked away. &quot;I know he'll give
me what you ne'er would. At least he has feelin' for me. More than you e'er
did. Or could.&quot; Then she turned back and looked at him for a long moment.
&quot;Say you'll go. Knowin' you're still. . .&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Damn it all!&quot; Spencer burst back through the
doorway. Then he spied the leather packet. &quot;That's it.&quot; He seized the
bundle and thrust it toward Hawksworth. &quot;Read these through, sirrah, and
you'll see clear enough what we're up against. There's absolutely no point
whatever in postin' a real ambassador now.&quot; He hesitated for a moment, as
though unsure how to phrase his next point. &quot;The most amazing thing is
what they say about the Great Moghul himself, the one they call Arangbar. The
Jesuits claim the man's scarcely ever sober. Seems he lives on some kind of
poppy sap they call opium, and on wine. He's a Moor sure enough, but he drinks
like a Christian, downs a full gallon of wine a day. E'en holds audiences with
a flagon in his hand. From the letters I can sense the Jesuits all marvel how
the damned heathen does it, but they swear 'tis true. No, sirrah, we can't send
some fancy-titled ambassador now. That's later. We want a man of quality, it
goes without sayin', but he's got to be able to drink with that damned Moor and
parlay with him in his cups. No Jesuit interpreters.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth steadied his hand on the carved arm of the chair,
still amazed by Maggie. &quot;What will your subscribers think about sending
the captain of a merchantman to the court of Moghul India?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Never you mind the subscribers. Just tell me if you'd
consider it. T’will be a hard voyage, and a perilous trip inland once you make
landfall. But you sail'd the Mediterranean half a decade, and you know enough
about the Turks.&quot; Spencer tapped his fingers impatiently on his
ink-stained blotter. &quot;And lest you're worried, have no doubt the Company
knows how to reward success.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth looked again at Maggie. Her blue eyes were mute as
stone.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;To tell the truth, I'm not sure I'm interested in a
voyage to India. George Elkington might be able to tell you the reason why.
Have you told me all of it?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Damn Elkington. What's he to do with this?&quot;
Spencer stopped in front of the desk and fixed Hawksworth's gaze. &quot;Aye,
there's more. But what I'm about to tell you now absolutely has to remain
between us. So have I your word?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth found himself nodding.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Very well, sir. Then I'll give you the rest. His
Majesty, King James, is sending a personal letter to be delivered to this Great
Moghul. And gifts. All the usual diplomatic falderal these potentates expect.
You'd deliver the whole affair. Now the letter'll offer full and free trade
between England and India, nothing more. Won't mention the Portugals. That'll
come later. This is just the beginning. For now all we want is a treaty to
trade alongside the damned Papists. Break their monopoly.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But why all the secrecy?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;'Tis plain as a pikestaff, sirrah. The fewer
know what we're plannin', the less chance of word gettin' out to the Portugals,
or the Hollanders. Let the Papists and the Butterboxes look to their affairs
after we have a treaty. Remember the Portugals are swarmin' about the Moghul’s
court, audiences every day. Not to mention a fleet of warships holdin' the
entire coast. And if they spy your colors, they're not apt to welcome you aland
for roast capon and grog.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Who else knows about this?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Nobody. Least of all that windbag Elkington, who'd have
it talk'd the length of Cheapside in a fortnight. He'll be on the voyage, I
regret to say, but just as Chief Merchant. Which is all he's fit for, though
I'd warrant he presumes otherwise.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'd like a few days to think about it.&quot; Hawksworth
looked again at Maggie, still disbelieving. &quot;First I'd like to see the <i>Discovery</i>.
And I'd also like to see your navigation charts for the Indian Ocean. I've seen
plenty of logs down to the Cape, and east, but nothing north from there.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And with good reason. We've got no rutters north of the
Cape. No English sea dog's ever sail'd it. But I've made some inquiries, and I
think I've located a salt here who shipp'd it once, a long time past. A
Dutchman named Huyghen. The truth is he was born and rais'd right here in
London. He started out a Papist and when things got a bit hot in England back
around time of the Armada he left for Holland. E'en took a Dutch name. Next he
mov'd on down to Portugal thinkin' to be a Jesuit, then shipp'd out to Goa and
round the Indies. But he got a bellyfull of popery soon enough, and came back
to Amsterdam. Some years later he help'd out their merchants by tellin' them
exactly how the Portugals navigate the passage round the Cape and out. The
Hollanders say hadn't been for the maps he drew up, they'd never have been able
to double the Cape in the first place. But he's back in London now, and we've
track'd him down. I understand he may've gone a bit daft, but perhaps 'twould
do no harm if you spoke to him.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And what about the <i>Discovery</i>? I want to see her
too.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;That you will, sir. She's in our shipyard down
at Deptford. Might be well if I just had Huyghen see you there. By all means
look her over.&quot; He beamed. &quot;And a lovelier sight you're ne'er like to
meet.&quot; Then, remembering himself, he quickly turned aside. &quot;Unless,
of course, 'twould be my Margaret here.&quot; . . .</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As agreed, Hawksworth was taken to Deptford the next day, the
Company's carriage inching through London's teeming streets for what seemed a
lifetime. His first sight of the shipyard was a confused tangle of planking,
ropes, and workmen, but he knew at a glance the <i>Discovery</i> was destined
to be handsome. The keel had been laid weeks before, and he could already tell
her fo'c'sle would be low and rakish. She was a hundred and thirty feet from
the red lion of her beakhead to the taffrail at her stern—where gilding already
was being applied to the ornate quarter galleries. She was five hundred tons
burden, each ton some six hundred cubic feet of cargo space, and she would
carry a hundred and twenty men when fully crewed. Over her swarmed an army of
carpenters, painters, coopers, riggers, and joiners, while skilled artisans
were busy attaching newly gilded sculptures to her bow and stern.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>That day they were completing the installation of the hull
chain-plates that would secure deadeyes for the shrouds, and he moved closer to
watch. Stories had circulated the docks that less than a month into the
Company's last voyage the mainmast yard of a vessel had split, and the
shipbuilder, William Benten, and his foreman, Edward Chandler, had narrowly
escaped charges of lining their pockets by substituting cheap, uncured wood.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He noticed that barrels of beer had been stationed around the
yard for the workmen, to blunt the lure of nearby alehouses, and as he stood
watching he saw Chandler seize a grizzled old bystander who had helped himself
to a tot of beer and begin forcibly evicting him from the yard. As they passed,
he heard the old man—clad in a worn leather jerkin, his face ravaged by decades
of salt wind and hard drink— reviling the Company.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What does the rottin' East India Company know o' the
Indies. You'll ne'er double the Cape in that pissin' shallop. 'Twould scarce
serve to ferry the Thames.&quot; The old man struggled weakly to loosen
Chandler's grasp on his jerkin. &quot;But I can tell you th' Portugals've got
carracks that'll do it full easy, thousand-ton bottoms that'd hold this skiff
in the orlop deck and leave air for a hundred barrel o' biscuit. An' I've shipped
'em. By all the saints, where's the man standin' that knows the Indies
better?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth realized he must be Huyghen. He intercepted him at
the edge of the yard and invited him to a tavern, but the old
Englishman-turned-Dutchman bitterly declined.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'll ha' none o' your fancy taverns, lad, aswarm wi'
pox-faced gentry fingerin' their meat pies. They'll ne'er take in the likes o'
me.&quot; Then he examined Hawksworth and flashed a toothless grin. &quot;But
there's an alehouse right down the way where a man wi' salt in his veins can
still taste a drop in peace.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>They went and Hawksworth had ordered the first round. When
the tankards arrived, Huyghen attacked his thirstily, maintaining a cynical
silence as Hawksworth began describing the Company's planned voyage, then asked
him what he knew of the passage east and north of the Cape. As soon as his
first tankard was dry, the old man spoke.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Aye, I made the passage once, wi' Portugals. Back
in'83. To Goa. An' I've been to the Indies many a time since, wi' Dutchmen. But
ne'er again to that pissin' sinkhole.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But what about the passage north, through the Indian
Ocean?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'll tell you this, lad, 'tis a sight different from
shootin' down to Java, like the Company's done before. 'Tis the roughest
passage you're e'er like to ship. Portugals post bottoms twice the burden o'
the Company's damn'd little frigates and still lose a hundred men e'ery voyage
out. When scurvy don't take 'em all. E'en the Dutchmen are scared o' it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then Huyghen returned to his stories of Goa. Something in the
experience seemed to preoccupy his mind. Hawksworth found the digression
irritating, and he impatiently pressed forward.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But what about the passage? How do they steer north</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>from the
Cape? The Company has no charts, no rutters by pilots who've made the
passage.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;An' how could they?&quot; Huyghen evaluated
Hawksworth's purse lying on the wooden table and discreetly signaled another
round. &quot;The Portugals know the trick, lad, but you'll ne'er find one o'
the whoremasters who'll give it out.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But is there a trade wind you can ride? Like the
westerly to the Americas?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Nothin' o' the sort, lad. But there's a wind sure
enough. Only she shifts about month by month. Give me that chart an' I'll show
you.&quot; Huyghen stretched for the parchment Hawksworth had brought, the new
Map of the World published by John Davis in 1600. He spread it over the table,
oblivious to the grease and encrusted ale, and stared at it for a moment in
groggy disbelief. Then he turned on Hawksworth. &quot;Who drew up this
map?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It was assembled by an English navigator, from charts
he made on his voyages.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;He's the lyin' son of a Spaniard's whore. I made this
chart o' the Indies wi' my own hand, years ago, for the Dutchmen. But what's
the difference? He copied it right.&quot; Huyghen spat on the floor and then
stabbed the east coast of Africa with a stubby finger. &quot;Now you come out
o' the Mozambique Channel and into the Indian Ocean too early in the summer,
and you'll be the only bottom fool enough to be out o' port. The monsoon'll
batter you to plankin'. Get there too late, say past the middle o' September,
and you're fightin' a head wind all the way. She's already turn'd on you. But
come north round by Sokatra near the end o' August and you'll ride a steady
gale right into North India. That's the tail o' the monsoon, lad, just before
the winds switch about. Two weeks, three at most, that's all you'll get. But
steer it true an' you'll make landfall just as India's ports reopen for the
autumn tradin' season.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Huyghen's voice trailed off as he morosely inspected the
bottom of his tankard. Hawksworth motioned for a third round, and as the old
man drew on the ale his eyes mellowed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Aye, you might make it. There's a look about you tells
me you can work a ship. But why would you want to be goin'?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>T’will
swallow you up, lad. I've only been to Goa, mind you, down on India's west
coastline, but that was near enough. I ne'er saw a man come back once he went
in India proper. Somethin' about it keeps 'em there. Portugals says she always
changes a man. He loses touch wi' what he was. Nothin' we know about counts for
anything there, lad.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What do you mean? How different could it be? I saw
plenty of Moors in Tunis.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Huyghen laughed bitterly. &quot;If you're thinkin' 'tis the
same as Tunis, then you're e'en a bigger fool than I took you for. Nay, lad,
the Moor part's the very least o' it.&quot; He drew on his tankard slowly,
deliberately. &quot;I've thought on't a considerable time, an' I think I've
decipher'd what 'tis. But 'tis not a thing easy to spell out.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Huyghen was beginning to drift now, his eyes glazed in warm
forgetfulness from the ale. But still he continued. &quot;You know, lad, I
actually saw some Englishmen go into India once before. Back in '83. Year I was
in Goa. An' they were ne'er heard from since.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth stared at the old man a moment, and suddenly the
name clicked, and the date—1583. Huyghen must have been the Dutch Catholic, the
one said to speak fluent English, who'd intervened for the English scouting
party imprisoned in Goa that year by the Portuguese. He tried to still his
pulse.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Do you remember the Englishmen's names?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Seem to recall they were led by a man nam'd Symmes. But
'twas a long time past, lad. Aye, Goa was quite the place then. Lucky I escap'd
when I did. E'en there, you stay awhile an' somethin' starts to hold you. Too
much o' India about the place. After a while all this&quot;—Huyghen gestured
fondly about the alehouse, where sweat-soaked laborers and seamen were
drinking, quarreling, swearing as they bargained with a scattering of weary
prostitutes in dirty, tattered shifts—&quot;all this seems . . .&quot; He took
a deep draft of ale, attempting vainly to formulate his thoughts. &quot;I've
ne'er been one wi' words. But don't do it, lad. You go in, go all the way in to
India, an' I'll wager you'll ne'er be heard from more. I've seen it
happen.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth listened as Huyghen continued, his stories of the
Indies a mixture of ale and dreams. After a time he signaled another round for
them both. It was many empty tankards later when they parted.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But Huyghen's words stayed. And that night Brian Hawksworth
walked alone on the quay beside the Thames, bundled against the wet autumn
wind, and watched the ferry lanterns ply through the fog and heard the muffled
harangues of streetwalkers and cabmen from the muddy street above. He thought
about Huyghen, and about the man named Roger Symmes, and about the voyage to
India.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>And he thought too about Maggie, who wanted him out of London
before her rich widower discovered the truth. Or before she admitted the truth
to herself. But either way it no longer seemed to matter.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>That night he decided to accept the commission. . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The <i>Discovery </i>rolled heavily and Hawksworth glanced
instinctively toward the pulley lines that secured the two bronze cannon. Then
he remembered why he had left the quarterdeck, and he unlocked the top drawer
of the desk and removed the ship's log. He leafed one more time through its
pages, admiring his own script—strong but with an occasional flourish.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Someday this could be the most valuable book in England, he
told himself. If we return. This will be the first log in England to describe
what the voyage to India is really like. The Company will have a full account
of the weather and sea, recorded by estimated longitude, the distance traveled
east.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He congratulated himself again on the care with which he had
taken their daily speed and used it to estimate longitude every morning since
the Cape, the last location where it was known exactly. And as he studied the
pages of the log, he realized how exact Huyghen's prediction had been. The old
man had been eerily correct about the winds and the sea. They had caught the
&quot;tail o' the monsoon&quot; precisely.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;August 27. Course N.E. ft E.; The wind at W.S., with
gusts and rain. Made 36 leagues today. Estimated longitude from the Cape 42° 50'
E.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;August 28. Course N.E.; The wind at west, a fresh gale,
with gusts and rain this 24 hours. Leagues 35. Estimated longitude from the
Cape, 44° 10' E.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The late August westerly Huyghen had foretold was carrying
them a good hundred land miles a day. They rode the monsoon's tail, and it was
still angry, but there was no longer a question that English frigates could
weather the passage.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As August drew to a close, however, scurvy had finally grown
epidemic on his sister ship, the <i>Resolve</i>. The men's teeth loosened,
their gums bled, and they began to complain of aching and burning in their
limbs. It was all the more tragic for the fact that this timeless scourge of
ocean travelers might at long last be preventable. Lancaster, on the very first
voyage of the East India Company, had stumbled onto an historic <i>Discovery</i>.
As a test, he'd shipped bottles of the juice of lemons on his flagship and
ordered every seaman to take three spoonfuls a day. And his had been the only
vessel of the three to withstand scurvy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth had argued with Captain Kerridge of the <i>Resolve</i>,
insisting they both stow lemon juice as a preventative. But Kerridge had always
resented Lancaster, particularly the fact he'd been knighted on return from a
voyage that showed almost no profit. He refused to credit Lancaster's findings.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;No connection. By my thinkin' Lancaster just had a run
o' sea-dog luck. Then he goes about claimin' salt meat brings on the scurvy. A
pack o' damn'd foolishness. I say salt meat's fine for the lads. Boil it up
with a mess o' dried peas and I'll have it myself. The <i>Resolve' </i>ll be
provision'd like always. Sea biscuit, salt pork, Hollander cheese. Any fool
knows scurvy comes from men sleepin' in the night dews off the sea. Secure your
gunports by night and you'll ne'er see the damn'd scurvy.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth had suspected Kerridge's real reason was the cost:
lemon juice was imported and expensive. When the Company rejected his own
request for an allowance, he had provisioned the <i>Discovery </i>out of his
own advance. Kerridge</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>had called
him a fool. And when they sailed in late February, the <i>Resolve</i> was
unprovided.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Just as Hawksworth had feared, the <i>Resolve's </i>crew had
been plagued by scurvy throughout the voyage, even though both vessels had put
in for fresh provisions at Zanzibar in late June. Six weeks ago, he had had no
choice but to order half his own remaining store of lemon juice transferred to
the sister ship, even though this meant reducing the <i>Discovery</i>'s ration
to a spoon a day, not enough.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>By the first week of September, they were so near India they
could almost smell land, but he dared not try for landfall. Not yet. Not
without an Indian pilot to guide them past the notorious sandbars and shoals
that lined the coast like giant submerged claws. The monsoon winds were dying.
Indian shipping surely would begin soon. So they hove to, waiting.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>And as they waited, they watched the last kegs of water choke
with green slime, the wax candles melt in the heat, and the remaining biscuit
all but disappear to weevils. Hungry seamen set a price on the rats that ran
the shrouds. How long could they last?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth reached the last entry in the log. Yesterday. The
day they had waited for.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Sept. 12. Laid by the lee. Estimated longitude from the
Cape, 50° 10' E. Latitude observed 20°30'. At 7 in the morning we command a
large ship from the country to heave to, by shooting four pieces across her
bow. Took from this ship an Indian pilot, paying in Spanish rials of eight.
First offered English gold sovereigns, but these refused as unknown coin. Also
purchased 6 casks water, some baskets lemons, melons, plantains.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The provisions had scarcely lasted out the day, spread over
twice a hundred hungry seamen. But with a pilot they could at last make
landfall.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>And landfall they had made, at a terrible price. Yet even
this anchorage could not be kept. It was too exposed and vulnerable. He had
expected it to be so, and he had been right. But he also knew where they might
find safety.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The previous night he had ordered the Indian pilot to sketch
a chart of the coastline on both sides of the Tapti River delta. He did not
tell him why. And on the map he had spotted a cove five leagues to the north,
called Swalley, that looked to be shallow and was also shielded by hills
screening it from the sea. Even if the Portuguese discovered them, the deep
draft of Portuguese galleons would hold them at sea. The most they could do
would be send boarding parties by pinnace, or fireships. The cove would buy
time, time to replenish stores, perhaps even to set the men ashore and attend
the sick. The longer the anchorage could be kept secret, the better their
chances. He had already prepared sealed orders for Captain Kerridge, directing
him to steer both frigates there after dark, when their movement could not be
followed by the hidden eyes along the coast.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He took a deep breath and flipped forward to a blank page in
the log.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>And realized this was the moment he had been dreading, been
postponing: the last entry for the voyage out. Perhaps his last ever—if events
in India turned against him. He swabbed more sweat from his face and glanced
one last time at the glistening face of the lute, wondering what he would be
doing now, at this moment, if he still were in London, penniless but on his
own.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then he wiped off the quill lying neatly alongside the
leather-bound volume, inked it, and shoved back the sleeve of his doublet to
write.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>         
The events of that morning were almost too improbable to be described. After
taking on the Indian pilot, Hawksworth's plan had been to make landfall
immediately, then launch a pinnace for Surat, there to negotiate trade for
their goods and safe conduct to the capital at Agra for himself. If things went
as planned, the goods would be exchanged and he would be on his way to the
Moghul capital long before word of their arrival could reach Goa and the
Portuguese.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The pilot's worth was never in question. A practiced seaman,
he had steered them easily through the uncharted currents and hidden swallows
of the bay. They had plotted a course directly east-north-east, running with
topgallants on the night breeze, to make dawn anchorage at the mouth of the
Tapti River. Through the night the <i>Resolve</i> had stayed with them handily,
steering by their stem lantern.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>When the first light broke in the east, hard and sudden,
there it lay—the coast of India, the landfall, the sight they had waited for
the long seven months. Amid the cheers he had ordered their colors hoisted—the
red cross, bordered in white, on a field of blue—the first English flag ever to
fly off India's coast.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But as the flag snapped its way along the poop staff, and the
men struck up a hornpipe on deck, their triumph suddenly was severed by a cry
from the maintop.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Sails off the starboard quarter.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>In the sudden hush that rolled across the ship like a shroud,
freezing the tumult of voice and foot, Hawksworth had charged up the
companionway to the quarterdeck. And there, while the masts tuned a melancholy
dirge, he had studied the ships in disbelief with his glass.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Four galleons anchored at the river mouth. Portuguese
men-of-war. Each easily a thousand ton, twice the size of the <i>Discovery</i>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He had sorted quickly through his options. Strike sail and
heave to, on the odds they may leave? It was too late. Run up Portuguese
colors, the old privateers' ruse, and possibly catch them by surprise?
Unlikely. Come about and run for open sea? Never. That's never an English
seadog's way. No, keep to windward and engage. Here in the bay.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Mackintosh!&quot; Hawksworth turned to see the quartermaster
already poised expectantly on the main deck. &quot;Order Malloyre to draw up
the gunports. Have the sails wet down and see the cookroom fire is out.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Aye, sir. This'll be a bloody one.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What counts is who bleeds most. Get every able man</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>on station.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As Hawksworth turned to check the whipstaff, the long wooden
lever that guided the ship's rudder, he passingly noted that curious conflict
of body sensation he remembered from two encounters in years past: once, when
on the Amsterdam run he had seen privateers suddenly loom off the coast of
Scotland, and then on his last voyage through the Mediterranean, when his
convoy first spotted the Turkish pirate galleys. While his mind calculated the
elements of a strategy, coolly refining each individual detail, his stomach
belied his rational facade and knotted in instinctive, primal fear. And he had
asked himself whether this day his mind or his body would prevail. The odds
were very bad, even if they could keep the wind. And if the Portuguese had
trained gun crews . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then he spotted the Indian pilot, leaning casually against
the steering house, his face expressionless. He wore a tiny moustache and long,
trimmed sideburns. And unlike the English seamen, all barefoot and naked to the
waist, he was still dressed formally, just as when he came aboard. A fresh
turban of white cotton, embroidered in a delicate brown, was secured neatly
about the crown of his head, exposing his long ears and small, jeweled
earrings. A spotless yellow cloak covered the waist of his tightly tailored
blue trousers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Damn him. Did he somehow know? Did he steer us into a trap?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Seeming to read Hawksworth's thoughts, the pilot broke the
silence between them, his Turki heavily accented with his native Gujarati.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;This is your first test. Officers of the Moghul’s army
are doubtless at the shore, observing. What will you do?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What do you think we'll do? We'll stand the bastards.
And with Malloyre's gunners I think we can . . .&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then permit me an observation. A modest thought, but
possibly useful. Do you see, there&quot;—he pulled erect and pointed toward the
shore—&quot;hard by the galleons, there where the seabirds swirl in a dark
cloud? That is the river mouth. And on either side are many sandbars, borne
there from the river's delta. Along the coast beyond these, though you cannot
see them now, are channels, too shallow for the draft of a galleon but perhaps
safe for these frigates. Reach them and you will be beyond range of all
Portuguese ordnance save their stern demi-culverin. Then they will be forced to
try boarding you by longboat, something their infantry does poorly and with
great reluctance.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Are there channels on both sides of the river mouth? To
windward and to leeward?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Certainly, my <i>feringhi </i> captain.&quot; He
examined Hawksworth with a puzzled stare. &quot;But only a fool would not hold
to port, to windward.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth studied the shoreline with the glass, and an
audacious gamble began to take form in his mind. Why try to keep both frigates
to windward? That's what they'll expect, and any moment now they'll weigh and
beat to windward also. And from their position, they'll probably gain the
weather gage, forcing us to leeward, downwind where we can't maneuver. That
means an open fight—when the <i>Resolve</i> can barely muster a watch. How can
she crew the gun deck and man the sheets? But maybe she won't have to. Maybe
there's another way.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Mackintosh.&quot; The quartermaster was mounting the
quarterdeck companionway. &quot;Order the mains'l and fores'l reefed. And the
tops'ls shortened. We'll heave to while we run out the guns. And signal the <i>Resolve</i>
while I prepare orders for Kerridge.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The grizzled Scotsman stood listening in dismay, and
Hawksworth read his thoughts precisely in his eyes. There's nae time to heave
to. And for wha'? We strike an inch o' canvas an' the fornicatin' Portugals'll
take the weather gage sure. Ha' you nae stomach for a fight? Why na just haul
down colors and ha' done with it?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But he said nothing. He turned automatically and bellowed
orders aloft.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth felt out the morning breeze, tasting its cut,
while he watched the seamen begin swinging themselves up the shrouds, warming
the morning air with oaths as the <i>Discovery </i>pitched and heeled in the
chop. And then he turned and strode down the quarterdeck companionway toward
the Great Cabin to prepare orders for the <i>Resolve</i>. As he passed along
the main deck, half a dozen crewmen were already unlashing the longboat from
its berth amidships.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>And when he emerged again on deck with the oilskin- wrapped
dispatch, after what seemed only moments, the longboat was already launched,
oarsmen at station. He passed the packet to Mackintosh without a word, then
mounted the companionway ladder back to the quarterdeck.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The Indian pilot stood against the banister, shaded by the
lateen sail, calmly studying the galleons.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Three of these I know very well.&quot; His accented
Turki was almost lost in a roll of spray off the stern. &quot;They are the <i>St.
Sebastian</i>, the <i>Bon Jesus</i>, and the <i>Bon Ventura</i>. They arrived
new from Lisbon last year, after the monsoon, to patrol our shipping lanes, to
enforce the regulation that all Indian vessels purchase a trading license from
authorities in Goa.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And what of the fourth?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It is said she berthed in Goa only this spring. I do
not know her name. There were rumors she brought the new Viceroy, but early,
before his four-year term began. I have never before seen her north, in these
waters.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>My God. Hawksworth looked at the warships in dismay. Is this
the course of the Company's fortune? A voyage depending on secrecy blunders
across a fleet bearing the incoming Viceroy of Goa. The most powerful
Portuguese in the Indies.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;They are invincible,&quot; the pilot continued, his
voice still matter-of-fact. &quot;The galleons own our waters. They have two
decks of guns. No Indian vessel, even the reckless corsairs along our southern
coast of Malabar, dare meet them in the open sea. Owners who refuse to submit
and buy a Portuguese trading license must sail hundreds of leagues off course
to avoid their patrol.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And what do you propose? That we heave to and strike
our colors? Without even a fight?&quot; Hawksworth was astonished by the
pilot's casual unconcern. Is he owned by the Portugals too?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You may act as you choose. I have witnessed many vain</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>boasts of
English bravery during my brief service aboard your ship. But an Indian captain
would choose prudence at such a time. Strike colors and offer to pay for a
license. Otherwise you will be handled as a pirate.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;No Englishman will ever pay a Portugal or a Spaniard
for a license to trade. Or a permit to piss.&quot; Hawksworth turned away,
trying to ignore the cold sweat beading on his chest. &quot;We never have. We
never will.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The pilot watched him for a moment, and then smiled.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You are in the seas off India now, Captain. Here the
Portuguese have been masters for a hundred years.&quot; His voice betrayed a
trace of annoyance at Hawksworth's seeming preoccupation, and he moved closer.
&quot;You would do well to hear me out. We know the Portuguese very well.
Better perhaps than you. Their cruelties here began a full century ago, when
the barbarous captain Vasco de Gama first discovered our Malabar Coast, near
the southern tip of India. He had the Portuguese nose for others' wealth, and
when he returned again with twenty ships, our merchants rose against him. But
he butchered their fleet, and took prisoners by the thousand. He did not,
however, simply execute them. First he cut away their ears, noses, and hands
and sent these to the local raja, recommending he make a curry. Next a
Portuguese captain named Albuquerque came with more warships to ravage our
trade in the north, that on the Red Sea. And when servants of Islam again rose
up to defend what is ours, Allah the Merciful once more chose to turn his face
from them, leaving all to defeat. Soon the infidel Portuguese came with many
fleets, and in a span no more than a male child reaching manhood, had seized
our ocean and stolen our trade.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The pilot's face remained blandly expressionless as he
continued, but he reached out and caught Hawksworth's sleeve. &quot;Next they
needed a Portuguese trading station, so they bribed pirates to help storm our
coastal fortress at Goa, an island citadel with a deep port. And this place
they made the collection point for all the pepper, spices, jewels, dyes,
silver, and gold they have plundered from us. They lacked the courage to invade
India herself, as the Moghuls did soon after, so they made our sea their
infidel empire. It is theirs, from the coast of Africa, to the Gulf of Persia,
to the Molucca Islands. And they seek not merely conquest, or enforced
commerce, but also our conversion to their religion of cruelty. They have
flooded our ports with ignorant priests. To them this is a crusade against
Islam, against the one True Faith, a crusade that has triumphed—for a
time—where barbarous Christian land assaults on our holy Mecca have always
failed.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then the pilot turned directly to Hawksworth and a smile
flickered momentarily across his lips. &quot;And now you English have come to
challenge them by sea. You must pardon me if I smile. Even if you prevail
today, which I must tell you I doubt, and even if one day more of your warships
follow and drive them from our seas entirely—even if all this should take
place, you will find your victory hollow. As theirs has been. For we have
already destroyed them. The way India consumes all who come with arms. The
ancient way. They have robbed our wealth, but in return we have consumed their
spirit. Until at last they are left with nothing but empty commodity. It will
be no different for you, English captain. You will never have India. It is
India who will have you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He paused and looked again toward the galleons, their sails
swelling on the horizon. &quot;But today I think the Portuguese will spare us
the trouble.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth examined the pilot, struggling to decipher his
words. &quot;Let me tell you something about England. All we ask is trade, for
you and for us, and we don't have any priests to send. Only Catholic traders do
that. And if you think we'll not stand well today, you know even less about the
English. The thing we do best is fight at sea. Our sea dogs destroyed the
entire navy of Spain twenty years ago, when they sent their Armada to invade
England, and even to this day the Spaniards and Portugals have never understood
our simple strategy. They still think a warship's merely a land fortress
afloat. All they know to do is throw infantry against a ship and try to board
her. The English know sea battles are won with cannon and maneuverability, not
soldiers.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth directed the pilot's gaze down the <i>Discovery</i>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>The ship was of the new English &quot;race-built&quot;
class, low in the water and swift. Absent were the bulky superstructures on bow
and stern that weighed down a galleon, the &quot;castles&quot; that Spanish and
Portuguese commanders used to stage infantry for boarding an enemy vessel. A
full thirty years before, the English seaman and explorer John Hawkins had
scoffed at these, as had Francis Drake and Walter Raleigh. They saw clearly
that the galleons' towering bow and stem, their forecastle and poop, slow them,
since the bluff beamy hull needed to support their weight wouldn't bite the
water. A superstructure above decks serves only to spoil a warship's handling
in a breeze, they declared, and to lend a better target to an English gunner.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Your ships assuredly are smaller than Portuguese
galleons, I agree,&quot; the pilot volunteered after a pause, &quot;but I see
no advantage in this.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You'll see soon enough. The <i>Discovery </i>may be
low, but she'll sail within six points of the wind, and she's quicker on the
helm than anything afloat.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth raised the glass and studied the galleons again.
As he expected they were beating to windward, laboring under a full head of
canvas.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Good. Now the <i>Resolve</i> can make her move.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The longboat was returning, its prow biting the trough of
each swell, while on the <i>Resolve</i> seamen swarmed the shrouds and rigging.
Hawksworth watched with satisfaction as his sister ship's main course swiveled
precisely into the breeze and her sprits'l bellied for a run down the wind. Her
orders were to steer to leeward, skirting the edge of the galleons' cannon
range.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>And if I know the Portugals, he told himself, they'll be
impatient enough to start loosing round after round of shot at her, even from a
quarter mile off. It takes courage to hold fire till you're under an enemy's
guns, but only then do you have accuracy. Noise and smoke are battle enough for
most Portugals, but the main result is to overheat and immobilize their cannon.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As the <i>Discovery</i> lay hove to, biding time, the <i>Resolve</i>
cut directly down the leeward side of the galleons, laboring</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>under full
press of sail, masts straining against the load. The Indian pilot watched the
frigate in growing astonishment, then turned to Hawksworth.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Your English frigates may be swift, but your English
strategy is unworthy of a common <i>mahout</i>, who commands an old
she-elephant with greater cunning. Your sister frigate has now forfeited the
windward position. Why give over your only advantage?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Even as he spoke the four Portuguese warships, caught beating
to windward, began to shorten sail and pay off to leeward to intercept the <i>Resolve</i>,
their bows slowly crossing the wind as they turned.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I've made a gamble, something a Portugal would never
do,&quot; Hawksworth replied. &quot;And now I have to do something no
Englishman would ever do. Unless outgunned and forced to.&quot; Before the
pilot could respond, Hawksworth was gone, heading for the gun deck.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The ring of his boots on the oak ladder leading to the lower
deck was lost in the grind of wooden trucks, as seamen threw their weight
against the heavy ropes and tackles, slowly hauling out the guns. The <i>Discovery</i>
was armed with two rows of truck-mounted cast-iron culverin, and she had sailed
with twenty-two barrels of powder and almost four hundred round shot.
Hawksworth had also stowed a supply of crossbar shot and deadly langrel—thin
casings filled with iron fragments—for use against enemy rigging and sail at
close quarters.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Shafts of dusty light from the gunports and overhead scuttles
relieved the lantern-lit gloom, illuminating the massive beams supporting the
decks above. Sleeping hammocks were lashed away, but the space was airless,
already sultry from the morning sun, and the rancid tang of sweat mixed with
fresh saltpeter from the gunpowder caught in Hawksworth's mouth, bittersweet.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He walked down the deck, alert to the details that could
spell victory or loss. First he checked the wooden tubs of vinegared urine and
the long swabs stationed between the cannon, used for cleaning burning
fragments of metal from the smoking barrels after each round. Fail to swab a
barrel and there could be an unplanned detonation when the next powder charge
was tamped into place. Then he counted the budge-barrels of powder, now swathed
in water-soaked blankets to fend off sparks, and watched as Edward Malloyre,
the man some called the best master gunner in England, inspected each cannon's
touchhole as its lead plate was removed, assuring himself it had not corroded
from the gases expelled during their last gunnery practice, in the Mozambique
Channel.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Master Malloyre.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Aye, sir, all's in order. We'll hand the Spanish
bastards a taste o' English iron.&quot; Malloyre, who had never troubled to
differentiate Portugal from Spain, was built like a bear, with short bowed legs
and a tree-stump frame. He drew himself erect, his balding pate easily clearing
the rugged overhead beams, and searched the gloom. &quot;The Worshipful Company
may ha' signed on a sorry lot o' pimpin' apple squires, but, by Jesus, I've
made Englishmen o' them. My sovereign to your shilling we hole the pox-rotted
Papists wi' the first round.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'll stand the wager, Malloyre, and add the last keg of
brandy. But you'll earn it. I want the portside battery loaded with crossbar
forward, and langrel aft. And set the langrel for the decks, not the
sail.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Malloyre stared at him incredulously. The command told him
immediately that this would be a battle with no quarter. The use of langrel
against personnel left no room for truce. Then suddenly the true implications
of Hawksworth's command hit him like a blow in the chest. &quot;That shot's for
close quarters. We lay alongside, and the bastards'll grapple and board us
sure. Swarm us like curs on a bitch.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That's the order, Malloyre. Be quick on it. Set the
starboard round first. And light the linstocks.&quot; Hawksworth turned to
count the shot and absently picked up one of the linstocks lying on deck—an
iron-plated staff used to set off a cannon—fingering the oil-soaked match rope
at its tip and inhaling its dank musk. And the smell awoke again the memory of
that last day two years before in the Mediterranean, with Turkish pirate
galleys fore and aft, when there had been no quarter, and no hope . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Beggin' your pardon, sir.&quot; Malloyre's voice was
urgent, bringing him back. &quot;What's the firin' orders?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Just fire the starboard round as a broadside, and set
for the lower gun deck.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Aye aye, sir.&quot; He paused. &quot;And Lord Jesus
pray we'll live to swab out.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Malloyre's parting words would have followed him up the
ladder to the main deck, but they were swallowed in the muffled roll of cannon
fire sounding over the bay. The galleons were spreading, circling the <i>Resolve</i>
as they bore down upon her, and they had begun to vomit round after round, jets
of water randomly around the frigate as she plunged toward the shallows and
safety. Any minute now, Hawksworth told himself, and she'll be in the shallows.
If she doesn't run aground on a bar.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then he saw the <i>Resolve</i> begin to come about, reefing
and furling her sails. She's made the shallows. And the Portugals' guns have
quieted.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Permission to set sail, sir. The bleedin' Portugals'll
be on her in a trice.&quot; Mackintosh stood on the quarterdeck by the steering
house. And he made no attempt to disguise the anxiety in his eyes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Give the Portugals time, Mackintosh, and you'll see
their second fatal mistake. The first was overheating the cannon on their upper
decks. The second will be to short-hand their crews. They're out of cannon
range now, so they'll launch longboats, and assign half the watch as oarsmen.
Here, take the glass. Tell me what you see.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Mackintosh studied the shallows with the telescope, while a
smile slowly grew on his hard face. &quot;I'm a motherless Dutchman. An'
there's a king's guard o' Portugal musketmen loadin' in. Wearin' their damn'd
silver helmets.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>They haven't changed in thirty years, Hawksworth smiled to
himself. The Portugals still think their infantry is too dignified to row, so
they assign their crews to the oars and leave their warships shorthanded. But
they won't find it easy to board the <i>Resolve</i> from longboats. Not with
English musketmen in her maintop. And that should give us just enough time. . .
.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Are all the longboats out yet, Mackintosh?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Aye, sir.&quot; The quartermaster steadied the glass
against the roll of the ship. &quot;And making for the <i>Resolve </i>like they
was runnin' from hell itself.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then bear full sail. Two points to windward of the
bastard on the left. Full press, and hoist the spritsail. Keep the wind and pay
her room till we're in range.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>With an exultant whoop Mackintosh jabbed the sweat-soaked
telescope toward Hawksworth, and began bellowing orders to the mates. Within
moments sails unfurled and snapped in the wind, sending the <i>Discovery</i>'s
bow biting into the chop and hurtling spray over the bulwarks. Hawksworth kept
to the quarterdeck, studying the nearest warship with the glass. The galleon's
forecastle towered above the horizon now like some Gothic fortress, and with
the glass he could make out pennants blazoned from all her yardarms. Then he
turned toward the Indian pilot, whose gaze was riveted on the Portuguese
warships.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What's the name of the galleon on the left, the large
one?&quot; Hawksworth pointed toward the vessel he had been observing with the
glass. &quot;I can't read it from this distance.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That one is the <i>Bon Ventura</i>. We know her to be
heavily armed.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'd say she's over a thousand tons burden. I wonder how
handy she'll be with her best men out in the longboats?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;She'll meet you soon enough, with her full bounty. It
is said that last year she caught and sank a twenty-gun Dutch frigate trading
in the Moluccas.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;She'll still have to come about into the wind.&quot;
Hawksworth seemed not to hear the pilot now, so absorbed was he in the looming
battle.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As though in answer to his thoughts, the <i>Bon Ventura </i>started
to heel slowly about, like an angered bull. But the <i>Discovery</i> now had
the windward position secure, and the Portuguese ship would have to tack
laboriously into the wind. Her canvas was close-hauled and she would be slow.
We've got the weather gage now, Hawksworth told himself, and we'll hold it.
Then he noticed that the second galleon in the row, the <i>St. Sebastian</i>,
had also begun wearing around, bringing her stern across the wind as she too
turned to meet the <i>Discovery</i>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;They've deciphered our plan,&quot; Hawksworth said
quietly to himself, &quot;and now it's two of the bastards we'll face. But with
luck we'll engage the <i>Bon Ventura</i> before the <i>St. Sebastian </i>can
beat to range. And the <i>Bon Ventura</i> is drawing away from the fleet. That
bit of bravado will cost her.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The <i>Discovery </i>was closing rapidly on the <i>Bon
Ventura</i>. In minutes they would be within range. Mackintosh was at the
whipstaff now, holding their course, his senses alert to every twist in the
wind. He involuntarily clenched and unclenched his teeth, while his knuckles
were bloodless white from his grip on the hardwood steering lever. Hawksworth
raised the glass again, knowing what he hoped to see.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The Portugals have just made their third mistake,
Mackintosh.&quot; He tried to mask his excitement. &quot;They've sealed the
lower gunports to shut out water while they're tacking. So after they get
position they'll still have to run out the lower guns.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Aye. That's why two-deckers won't buy a whore's
chastity on a day like this. But they'll have the upper guns on us soon
enough.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Wait and see, Mackintosh. I'll warrant their upper guns
are overheated by now. They'll think twice about trying to prime them just yet.
They'll have to wait a bit. Perhaps just long enough for us to get alongside.
Then the upper guns'll touch nothing but our rigging.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The breeze freshened even more, driving the <i>Discovery </i>rapidly
toward her target. Mackintosh eyed the galleon nervously, knowing the frigate
was heavily outgunned. Finally he could bear the tension no longer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We've got range now. Permission to bring her
about.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Steady as she goes. They're slow on the helm.&quot;
Hawksworth glanced at the line of seamen along the port side, untying bundles
of musket arrows and lighting the linstock. &quot;Bosun! Are the men at
stations?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Aye, sir.&quot; A gravel voice sounded through the din.
&quot;Stocks were a bit damp, but I warrant the hellish sun's dryin' 'em out.
We'll give the fornicators a fine English salute.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth gauged the galleon's course, estimating her speed
and her ability to maneuver. Then he saw her start coming about in the water,
turning to position the starboard battery for a broadside. Gunports on the
lower deck flipped up and cannon began slowly to emerge, like hard black fangs.
Nervous sweat began to bead on Mackintosh's brow as the <i>Discovery </i>held
her course directly down the galleon's windward side.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The <i>Bon Ventura</i>'s broadside battery was not yet set,
but a sudden burst of black smoke from her starboard bow-chaser sent a ball
smashing through the <i>Discovery's </i>quarter gallery, removing much of its
ornate embellishment. Then came another flare of smoke and flame, hurtling a
second ball through the lateen sail above Mackintosh's head. The quartermaster
went pale, and looked imploringly at Hawksworth.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Steady as she goes, Mackintosh, they still haven't
fully set their guns.&quot; The knot in Hawksworth's stomach was like a searing
ball of fire. God, for a brandy. But we've got to hold till we've got sure
range. To come about now would keep our distance, and mean a classic battle.
One we're sure to lose.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He pushed away the realization of the immense chance they
were taking. But now there was no turning back, even if he wanted. Finally he
could bear it no longer. God make it right.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Now, Mackintosh! Bring her hard about!&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The quartermaster threw his weight against the whipstaff,
shouting orders to the two seamen on the deck below to haul the tackles on the
tiller, helping him flip the rudder. Then he turned and bellowed commands to
the mates.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Hands to the braces. Bring her hard about.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The seamen poised incredulously in the maintop and foretop
cheered as they began to haul in the ropes securing the yards, and in moments
the sails swiveled off the wind. The <i>Discovery </i>careened in the chopping
seas, responding readily to the shift in rudder and canvas. By this time
Hawksworth was standing over the scuttle above the gun deck, shouting to
Malloyre.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Coming about. Prepare to fire the starboard battery
when your guns bear.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The <i>Discovery</i> had wheeled a sharp arc in the water,
laying herself broadside to the galleon, hardly fifty yards away. The English
seamen aloft stared mutely at the towering forecastle of the Portuguese
warship, most never before having seen a galleon at close range. Although the
guns on her upper deck were still silent, had they spoken now they would have
touched nothing but the frigate's tops'ls. But as the galleon turned, the
cannon on her lower deck were coming into final position. In moments she would
lay the <i>Discovery</i> with a broadside. Hawksworth watched her carefully,
calculating, and then the knot in his stomach dissolved like ice in the sun.
The <i>Discovery </i>would be in position seconds ahead.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Malloyre's command to fire cut the awe-stricken silence. The
next instant a low roar seemed to emanate from all the timbers of the English
frigate, while red-tipped flame tongued from her starboard side. The ship
heeled dangerously sideways, while black smoke, acrid and searing, boiled up
through the scuttles and hatch, as though propelled on its way by the round of
cheers from below decks, the traditional salute of ship's gunners. Hawksworth
later remembered noting that the battery had fired in perfect unison, not
losing the set of a single gun by the ship's recoil.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>A medley of screams came first, piercing the blackened air.
Then the smoke drifted downwind, over the side of the <i>Bon Ventura</i>,
revealing a savage incision where her lower gun deck had once been. Cannon were
thrown askew, and the mangled forms of Portuguese gunners, many with limbs
shattered or missing, could be seen through the splintered hull. But Hawksworth
did not pause to inspect the damage; he was already yelling the next orders to
Mackintosh, hoping to be heard above the din. The advantage of surprise would
be short-lived.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Pay off the helm! Bring her hard about!&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Again the rudder swiveled in its locks, while seamen aloft</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>hauled the
sheets and braces, but this time the <i>Discovery </i>came about easily, using
the wind to advantage. As he turned to check the whipstaff, Hawksworth heard a
high-pitched ricochet off the steering house and sensed a sudden dry numbness
in his thigh. Only then did he look up to see the line of Portuguese musketmen
on the decks of the <i>Bon Ventura</i>, firing sporadically at the English
seamen on decks and aloft.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Damn. A lucky shot by some Lisbon recruit. He seized a
handful of coarse salt from a bucket by the binnacle and pressed it against the
blood. A flash of pain passed briefly through his consciousness and then was
forgotten. The <i>Discovery's </i>stern had crossed the wind. There was no time
to lose. He moved down the companionway to again shout orders to Malloyre on
the gun deck. &quot;Set for the fo'c'sle and rigging. Fire as your guns
bear.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The <i>Bon Ventura</i> still lay immobile, so unexpected had
been the broadside. But a boarding party of Portuguese infantry was poised on
the galleon's forecastle superstructure, armed with swords and pikes, ready to
fling grapples and swing aboard the frigate. The Portuguese had watched in
helpless amazement as the <i>Discovery</i> completely came about and again was
broadside. Suddenly the captain of the infantry realized what was in store and
yelled frantically at his men to take cover. But his last command was lost in
the roar of the <i>Discovery's </i>guns.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>This time flames and smoke erupted from the <i>Discovery's </i>portside
battery, but now it spewed knife-edged chunks of metal and twisting crossbars.
Again the screams came first, as the musketmen and infantry on the fo'c'sle
were swept across the decks in the deadly rain. Crossbars chewed through the
galleon's mainsail, parting it into two flapping remnants, while the rigging on
the foremast was blown by the boards, tangling and taking with it a party of musketmen
stationed in the foretop. Now the galleon bobbed helpless in the water, as the
last seamen remaining on the shrouds plunged for the decks and safety.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;When you're ready, Mackintosh.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The quartermaster signaled the bosun, and a line of</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>seamen along
the port gunwales touched musket arrows to the lighted linstock and took aim.
Streaks of flame forked into the tattered rigging of the <i>Bon Ventura</i>,
and in moments her canvas billowed red. Again the Portuguese were caught
unaware, and only a few manned water buckets to extinguish the burning shreds
of canvas drifting to the deck.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>They were almost alongside now, but no Portuguese infantry
would pour down the side of the forecastle onto their decks. The galleon's
decks were a hemorrhage of the wounded and dying.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;By Jesus, 'tis a sight for English eyes.&quot; Edward
Malloyre's blackened face, streaked with sweat, bobbed up through the hatch
over the gun deck, and he surveyed the wreckage of the <i>Bon Ventura</i>.
&quot;Had to give 'er a look, Cap'n. See if my lads earn'd their biscuit.&quot;
He beamed with open pride.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Malloyre, how does it stand below decks?&quot;
Hawksworth yelled from the quarterdeck.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Starboard side's swabbed out. How shall we load 'em,
sir?&quot; Malloyre leaned backward to gain a better look at the galleon, which
now towered above them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Round shot, and run them out fast as you can.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Aye, sir. An' no more close quarters if you please.
Ne'er want to be this close to one o' the bastards again.&quot; Malloyre
started to retreat through the hatch, but then he turned, paused for a second,
and yelled at Hawksworth. &quot;Beggin' your pardon, Cap'n. I knew all along
'twas best to pull alongside and lay 'em wi' crossbar. Just wanted to give the
lads a bit o' a scare. Keep 'em jumpin'.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth waved his hand and watched as Malloyre's pudgy
frame dropped through the gun-deck hatch like a rabbit diving for its warren.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Mackintosh was standing on the main deck, his tangled red
mane blackened with smoke, watching as the <i>Discovery </i>drifted slowly
toward the side of the bobbing galleon. Then, when they were only feet away, he
signaled the bosun, and a line of English seamen lit the waiting fuses and
began to loft clay powder pots across the waist of the <i>Bon Ventura</i>, now
almost above their heads. When they had finished, he passed orders and the <i>Discovery
</i>began to pull away, before her sails could ignite. Then one by one the
powder pots started to explode, spewing burning sulphur over the Portuguese
vessel's decks.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth watched the carnage, and asked himself if he had
been right to do what he'd done. They'd have sunk us. Cut down the men and
taken the officers and merchants to a Goa prison. And then what? We couldn't
have sunk them with cannon in a week. The only choice was fire.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then he turned to see the <i>St. Sebastian </i>making toward
them. Her cannon were already run out, and at any moment she would start coming
about for a broadside. Again he felt the throb in his thigh, and it triggered a
wave of fear that swept upward from his stomach. The Indian pilot stood next to
him, also watching the approaching galleon.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I have seen a miracle, Captain. Allah the Compassionate
has watched over you today.&quot; The pilot's face showed none of the strain of
battle. And his clothes were still spotless, oddly immune from the oily smoke
that blackened all the English seamen. &quot;But I fear there cannot be two
miracles on the same morning. You are about to pay for your fortune. Perhaps
there is still time to strike your colors and save the lives of your men.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We surrender now and we'll rot in a Goa prison forever.
Or be pulled apart on the <i>strappado</i>.&quot; Hawksworth glared back.
&quot;And I seem to recall the Quran says 'Do not falter when you've gained the
upper hand.'&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You do not have the upper hand, my Captain, and the
Holy Quran speaks only of those who trust in Allah, the Merciful. . . .&quot;
His voice trailed off as he turned to stare at Hawksworth. &quot;It is not
common for a <i>feringhi</i> to know the Holy Quran. How is it you--?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I just spent two years in a Turkish prison, and I heard
little else.&quot; Hawksworth turned and was testing the wind, weighing his
options. The <i>St. Sebastian </i>was almost on them. Her cannon were already
run out, and at any moment she would start coming about for a broadside. He
could still hear the trucks of the cannon below decks, as the starboard battery
was being run out, and he knew the portside crews were only now beginning to
swab the last glowing shreds of metal from the cannon barrels.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Good God, there's no time to set the ordnance. They'll blow
us to hell. He deliberated for a long moment, weighing his options. As he
watched, the <i>St. Sebastian </i>began to shorten sail, preparing to come
about and fire. Only minutes remained. Then he noticed that the wind on the
burning <i>Bon Ventura's </i>superstructure was drifting her in the direction
of the approaching <i>St. Sebastian</i>, and he hit on another gamble. They've
shortened sail in order to come about, which means they're vulnerable. Now if I
can make them try to take their bow across the wind, with their sails shortened
. . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Mackintosh, take her hard about! Set the courses for a
port tack.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Once again the <i>Discovery</i> heeled in the water, her
stern deftly crossing the wind, and then she was back under full sail, still to
windward of the burning galleon. The sudden tack had left the burning <i>Bon
Ventura </i>directly between the English frigate and the approaching galleon.
The <i>Discovery </i>pulled away, keeping the wind, forcing the galleon to tack
also if she would engage them. Hawksworth watched, holding his breath as
Portuguese seamen began to man the sheets, bringing the <i>St. Sebastian's </i>bow
into the wind.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It was fatal. The approaching galleon had shortened too much
sail in preparation to come about for the broadside, and now she lacked the
momentum to cross the wind. Instead the sluggish, top-heavy warship hung in
stays, her sails slack, her bulky bow fighting the wind, refusing to pay off
onto the opposite tack. All the while the <i>Bon Ventura</i> was drifting
inexorably toward her, flaming.     I was right, Hawksworth thought. She didn't
have the speed to bring her bow around. With his glass he watched the galleon's
captain order her back to the original tack. But time had run out.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Blinding explosions suddenly illuminated the gunports of the
burning <i>Bon Ventura</i>, as powder barrels on the gun decks ignited, first
the upper and then the lower. In only moments the fire found the powder room
aft of the orlop deck, and as the English seamen looked on spellbound the
galleon seemed to erupt in a single cloud of fire, rocketing burning timbers
and spars across the sea's surface. The mainmast, flaming like a giant taper,
snapped and heaved slowly into the fo'c'sle. Then the superstructure on the
stern folded and dropped through the main deck, throwing a plume of sparks high
into the morning air.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Although the <i>St. Sebastian </i>had righted herself, she
still had not regained speed, for now the sails had lost their luff and sagged
to leeward. Why isn't she underway, Hawksworth asked himself, surely she'll
circle and engage us? He looked again with the glass and the reason became
clear. The Portuguese crewmen on the <i>St. Sebastian</i> had begun throwing
themselves into the sea, terrified at the sight of the <i>Bon Ventura's </i>blazing
hull drifting slowly across their bow. The wind had freshened again and was
pushing the burning galleon rapidly now. The blaze had become an inferno,
fueled by casks of coconut oil stored below decks on the galleon, and
Hawksworth involuntarily shielded his eyes and face from the heat that, even at
their distance, seared the <i>Discovery</i>. As he watched, the drifting <i>Bon
Ventura </i>suddenly lurched crazily sideways, and then came the sound of a
coarse, grinding impact, as her burning timbers sprayed across the decks of the
<i>St. Sebastian</i>. In moments the second galleon was also an abandoned
inferno, her crew long since afloat in the safety of the sea, clinging to
debris and making for shore.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Allah has been merciful twice to you in one morning,
Captain. I had never before known the extent of His bounty. You are a man most
fortunate.&quot; The pilot's words, spoken softly and with pronounced gravity,
were almost drowned in the cheers that engulfed the decks and rigging of the <i>Discovery</i>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;The battle's just begun. Boarding parties are
at the <i>Resolve</i>, and there are two more galleons.&quot; Hawksworth
reached for the glass by the binnacle.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;No, Captain, I doubt very much the Portuguese will
trouble you further. Your luck has been too exceptional. But they will return
another day.&quot; The pilot squinted toward the shore, as though confirming
something he knew should be there.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth trained his glass on the two galleons that still
held the <i>Resolve</i> pinned in the shallows. They were heeling about,
preparing to run southward on the wind under full press of sail. He also
realized their longboats had been abandoned. Some were following futilely after
the retreating galleons, while others were already rowing toward the river
mouth. The English frigate had been forgotten. Then he noted that although
pennants no longer flew from the yardarms of the galleons, the large, unnamed
vessel had run out a brilliant red ensign on her poop staff. He studied it
carefully, then turned to the pilot, extending the glass.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Take a look and tell me what the colors are on the
large man-of-war. I've never seen them before.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The pilot waved away the telescope with a smile. &quot;I need
no Christian device to tell you that. We all know it. With all your fortune,
you have failed to understand the most important thing that happened
today.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And what is that?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Those are the colors of the Viceroy of Goa, flown only
when he is aboard his flagship. You have humiliated him today. The colors speak
his defiance. His promise to you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As the pilot spoke, Mackintosh came bounding up the
companionway to the quarterdeck, his soot-covered face beaming. &quot;What a
bleedin' day! <i>What </i>a bleedin' day!&quot; Then his eyes dimmed for an
instant. &quot;But a man'd be called a liar who told the story.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;How many dead and wounded, Mackintosh?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Two maintopmen killed by musket fire. And a bosun's
mate took a splinter in the side, very bad, when the bastards laid us wi' the
first bowchasers. A few other lads took musket fire, but the surgeon'll sew 'em
up fine.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then break out the last keg of brandy. And see that
Malloyre's men get the first tot. . . but don't forget to send a tankard to the
quarterdeck.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Mackintosh broke an appreciative grin and headed down the
companionway ladder. The sun was baking the decks now, and a swarm of locusts
had appeared from nowhere to buzz about the maintop. The wind was beginning to
slacken in the heat, and silence slowly settled over the <i>Discovery</i>.
Hawksworth turned his glass one last time to the large galleon. He could still
make out the ensign over the crests of surf, blood red in the sun.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The bells sounded ending the afternoon watch and calling the
first dog watch. Only four hours since noon, but already the morning's carnage
seemed a memory from a distant lifetime. Sultry tropic air, motionless and
stifling, immersed the <i>Discovery</i> as the gaunt-faced seamen labored to
finish securing the mast of the pinnace. Mackintosh had ordered the pinnace's
sail unrolled on deck, and as he inspected the stitches for rot he alternately
reviled the men, the heat, the Company. Hawksworth had completed the log and
stood in the companionway outside the Great Cabin to watch the preparations, take
the air, and exercise his leg. All the previous night he had stood on the
quarterdeck, keeping the helm and translating for the pilot. And tonight again
there would be no sleep. There's time for a rest now, his weary mind urged,
till the first bell of this watch, half an hour. Then he cursed himself for his
weakness, his readiness to yield, and shoved open the door of the Great Cabin.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The oil lamp swayed with each roll of the ship, punctuating
the rhythmic creak of the wood paneling and adding to the sweltering heat. He
locked the door, then strode aft to push ajar the two stern windows. But the
stolid air lay inert, refusing to lift. He would have to prepare the chest in
suffocating misery. So be it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Brushing the hair back from his eyes, he unlocked a bronzed
sea chest and began to extract one by one the articles entrusted to the Company
by King James. First was the letter, in English with a formal copy in
diplomatic Spanish, both scribed on parchment and sealed in a leather case
secured with His Majesty's impression in red wax. The seal, set in London over
seven months before, was soft in the heat now, pliant to his touch. He surveyed
the room for a moment and then his eye hit on the pair of formal thigh- length
stockings the Company had insisted he pack. Perfect. He bound his hose around
the king's letter, knotted it protectively over the seal, and tossed the bundle
into the smaller wooden chest he would take ashore.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then he began to transfer the royal presents: a brace of
gold-plated pistols, a half dozen silver-handled swords, a small silver-trimmed
saddle, a set of delicate Norwich crystal, jeweled rings, a leather-bound
mirror, a silver whistle studded with emeralds, a large cocked hat trimmed in
silk, a miniature portrait of King James, and finally, a dozen bottles of fine
English sack. He checked each item for damage and then packed them tightly into
the small chest. Finally he inserted a tightly fitting false bottom and covered
it with a coarse woolen rug.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then the second packing began. He started with more gifts,
these for port officials, mainly silver-trimmed knives and rings set with small
inexpensive pearls. He also enclosed several boxed sets of English gold
sovereigns, which the Company had requested be distributed as widely as
possible, in hopes they would begin to be accepted.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Finally he looked about the room for personal goods. First he
folded in a new leather jerkin, then next to it packed a new pair of leather
boots. He stared at the boots for a moment, and then removed them while he
carefully wrapped two primed pistols and slid one deep into each hollow toe.
Next to the boots he packed a case of Spanish brandy he had been saving, for
personal use aland. Lastly he took his glistening English lute from its corner
berth, held it for a moment, and tested the strings. He adjusted the tuning on
one string, then wrapped the lute's melon-shaped body in a silk cloth, and
nestled it next to the brandy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As he secured the lock on the chest and pocketed the large
brass key, he suddenly asked himself how he would get the chest into India
without its being searched. I'm not a genuine ambassador. I'm the captain of a
merchantman, with no</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>diplomatic
standing. The Company, for all its mercantile wisdom, neglected to consider
that small difficulty.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>So I'll just have to sound like an ambassador. That shouldn't
be so hard. Just be impressed with your own importance. And find nothing, food
or lodgings, sufficiently extravagant.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then he drew himself erect and unlocked the door of the Great
Cabin. Only one thing remained.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Mackintosh!&quot; The quartermaster was in the pinnace
now, fitting the tiller, and he glanced up in irritation. &quot;Send the pilot
to my cabin.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth had scarcely seated himself behind the great oak
table before the tall chestnut-skinned man appeared in the doorway. Hawksworth
examined the face again, expressionless and secure, asking himself its years.
Is he thirty; is he fifty? The features seemed cast from an ageless mold, hard
and seamless, immune to time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;May I be of service?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Repeat your name for me.&quot; Hawksworth spoke in
Turkish. &quot;And tell me again the business of your vessel.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;My name is Karim Hasan Ali.&quot; The reply came
smoothly, but almost too rapidly for Hawksworth to follow. &quot;My ship was
the Rahimi, a pilgrim vessel on her return voyage from Mecca, by way of Aden,
to our northern port of Diu. We carry Muslim pilgrims outbound from India in
the spring, and return after the monsoon. As you assuredly must know, for a
thousand years Mecca has been the shrine all followers of Islam must visit once
in their life. Our cabins are always full.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth recalled the vessel, and his astonishment at her
size. She had had five masts and was easily twelve hundred tons, over twice the
burden of the <i>Discovery</i> and greater than anything he had ever seen before,
even the most ambitious Spanish carrack. But when they spotted her, tacking
eastward across the Bay of Cambay, she was unarmed and hove to almost before
they had fired across her bow. Why unarmed, he had asked himself then, and why
strike so readily? Now he understood.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And you were the pilot for the <i>Rahimi</i>?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I am called the <i>musallim</i>.” A note of formality
entered the Indian's voice and he instinctively drew himself more erect.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Is that the pilot?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Yes, but more. Perhaps it is like your first mate. But
I am in full charge of navigation for the <i>nakuda</i>, the owner. To you he
would be captain.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And what was your salary for the voyage?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I received two hundred rupees for the trip to Aden, and
am allowed two extra cabins of goods for personal trade.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth smiled resignedly to himself, remembering he had
unquestioningly delivered to the <i>nakuda </i>a bag of Spanish rials of eight
equivalent to five hundred Indian rupees to buy out the pilot's contract. Then
he spoke.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Tonight, we go upriver to Surat. You're still in my
service and you'll be pilot.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I had expected it. I know the river well.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Will there be any Portugal traders on the river?&quot;
Hawksworth searched his eyes hoping to monitor their truthfulness.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I would not expect it. Although this year's monsoons
are past and the river has returned to normal, there are new sandbanks. Every
season they shift, becoming more treacherous. Only those of us who know the
river well understand the moods of her sands. I have never seen <i>topiwallah </i>traders
in Surat this early in the season.&quot; Karim paused, following Hawksworth's
puzzled expression, then continued, with an air of condescension,&quot; <i>Topiwallah
</i>is our word meaning 'men who wear hats.' We call Christian traders <i>topiwallahs</i>.&quot;
He fixed Hawksworth squarely. &quot;And we have other names for their
priests.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Call Christians what you will, but just remember
England is not Portugal.&quot; Hawksworth's tone stiffened. &quot;England has
rid herself of the popery that still rules the Spaniards and Portugals. Along
with their fear-mongering Jesuits and their damned Inquisition. It's now
treason to practice Catholic rites in England.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I have heard something of your petty European
squabbles, your Christian rivalries. Is it your intention now to spread them to
India as well?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;All England wants is trade. Nothing else.&quot;
Hawksworth shifted his leg, leaning forward to tighten the bandage. &quot;I'm
here as an ambassador. To convey the friendship of my king, and his offer of
free and open trade.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And after you begin this trade, what then? Will you
next try to drive the Portuguese from our ports? So that you can steal away
shipping from our own merchantmen, as they have done, and demand we pay you for
a license to ply our own seas?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I told you we only want trade. England has no use for
sailing licenses, or priests. Our only enemies here are the Portugals. And the
damned Hollanders if they start trying to interfere.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Karim studied Hawksworth in silence, fingering his jeweled
earring in thought as he recalled the morning's battle. Two small English
merchant frigates had prevailed over four Portuguese warships, galleons. Never
before, he told himself, have the Portuguese been humiliated before our eyes.
Pigeons must already be winging word of this incredible encounter to Agra.
Separately, no doubt, to the Moghul and to the queen. But Queen Janahara will
know first. As always. And she will know her Portuguese profits are no longer
secure.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>And what about Prince Jadar? Yes, the prince will already
have heard, hours ago. What will Prince Jadar decide to do? That's the most
important question now.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Just tell me about the navigation of the river,&quot;
Hawksworth continued unable to decipher Karim's distant expression. &quot;How
long will it take for our pinnace to reach Surat? We cast off at sunset.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The tide will be running in tonight, and that will aid
your oarsmen.&quot; Karim instantly became businesslike. &quot;There will also
be a night breeze off the sea. But the Portuguese have no authority on our
river. Once you are inland you are under the rule of the governor of Surat. . .
. and, of course, Prince Jadar, whom the Moghul has appointed to administrate
this province.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth heard the first bell and walked to the stern</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>windows to
monitor the slant of the dying sun and to inhale the fresh evening air. Then he
wheeled and examined Karim, the pilot's face shadowed in the half light.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And who are these officials? This governor and
prince?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Karim smiled and carefully secured the fold of his turban.
&quot;The governor administers the port of Surat. He collects trading duties of
the Moghul’s court in Agra. Prince Jadar is the son of the Moghul and the
military ruler of Gujarat, this province.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then who will I meet in Surat?&quot; Hawksworth groped
for a pattern. &quot;The governor or the prince?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Again Karim paused, wondering how much to tell, before
continuing evenly, &quot;Neither of these need concern you now. The first
official you must satisfy will be the Shahbandar, what the Moghuls call the <i>mutasaddi</i>.
The Shahbandar controls the customs house, the portal for all who would enter
the Moghul’s domain. His power over the port is absolute.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth slapped one of the bronze cannon to punctuate his
dismay.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>In India also! Good Jesus, every Muslin port in the world
must have this same petty official. I've heard that Shahbandar is Persian for
&quot;Lord of the Haven,&quot; and if that's true the office is named
perfectly. Every one I've known has had the right to refuse entry to anyone, at
his whim, if bribes are insufficient and no more powerful official intervenes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Who does the Shahbandar here answer to? The governor?
The prince? The Moghul himself? Or somebody <i>else </i>you haven't told me
about yet?&quot; Hawksworth tried to push back his rising anxiety.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Captain, you have, in your guileless <i>feringhi </i>way,
raised a question it is wiser not to pursue. I can only assure you the
Shahbandar is a man of importance in Surat, and in India.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But who should I seek out when we reach Surat?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>At that moment two bells sounded on the quarterdeck, and with
them a ray from the fading sun pierced the stern window, glancing off the oak
boards of the table. A twilight silence seemed to settle uneasily over the <i>Discovery</i>,
amplifying the creaking of her boards.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Captain, I have already told you more than most
foreigners know. You would be wise to prepare now to meet the Shahbandar.&quot;
Karim rose abruptly and bowed, palms together, hands at his brow. &quot;You
must forgive me. In Islam we pray at sunset.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth stared after him in perplexity as Karim turned and
vanished into the darkened companionway.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Not yet even aland, and already I sense trouble. He fears the
Shahbandar, that's clear enough, but I'm not sure it's for the usual reasons.
Is there some intrigue underway that we're about to be drawn into, God help us?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He took a deep breath and, fighting the ache in his leg, made
his way out to the quarter gallery on the stern. A lone flying fish, marooned
in the bay from its home in the open sea, burst from the almost placid waters,
glinting the orange sun off its body and settling with a splash, annoying the
seabirds that squabbled over gallery scraps along the port side. Seamen
carrying rations of salt pork and biscuit were clambering down the companionway
and through the hatch leading to the lower deck and their hammocks. Hawksworth
listened to them curse the close, humid air below, and then he turned to inhale
again the land breeze, permeated with a green perfume of almost palpable
intensity.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Following the direction of the sweetened air, he turned and
examined the darkening shore one last time. India now seemed vaguely obscured,
as through a light mist. Or was it merely encroaching darkness? And through
this veil the land seemed somehow to brood? Or did it beckon?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It's my imagination, he told himself. India is there all
right, solid ground, and scarcely a cannon shot away. India, the place of fable
and mystery to Englishmen for centuries. And also the place where a certain
party of English travelers disappeared so many years ago.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>That should have been a warning, he told himself. It's almost
too ironic that you're the next man to try to go in. You, of all the men in
England. Are you destined to repeat their tragedy?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He recalled again the story he knew all too well. The man
financing those English travelers almost three decades past</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>had been
none other than Peter Elkington, father of George Elkington, Chief Merchant on
this voyage. Like his son, Peter Elkington was a swearing, drinking, whoring
merchant, a big-bellied giant of a man who many people claimed looked more and
more like King Harry the older and fatter he got. It was Peter Elkington's
original idea those many years back to send Englishmen to India.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The time was before England met and obliterated the Armada of
Spain, and long before she could hope to challenge the oceanic trade networks
of the Catholic countries—Spain to the New World, Portugal to the East. In
those days the only possible road to India for England and the rest of Europe
still was overland, the centuries-old caravan trail that long preceded
Portugal's secret new sea route around the Cape.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The idea of an English mission overland to India had grown
out of Peter Elkington's Levant Company, franchised by Queen Elizabeth to
exploit her new treaty with the Ottoman Turks, controllers of the caravan trade
between India and the Mediterranean. Through the Levant Company, English
traders could at last buy spices directly at Tripoli from overland caravans
traveling the Persian Gulf and across Arabia, thereby circumventing the greedy
Venetian brokers who for centuries had served as middlemen for Europe's pepper
and spices.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But Peter Elkington wanted more. Why buy expensive spices at
the shores of the Mediterranean? Why not extend England's own trade lines all
the way to India and buy directly?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>To gain intelligence for this daring trade expansion, he
decided to finance a secret expedition to scout the road to India, to send a
party of English traders through the Mediterranean to Tripoli, and on from
there in disguise across Arabia to the Persian Gulf, where they would hire
passage on a native trader all the way to the western shore of India. Their ultimate
destination was the Great MoghuFs court, deep in India, and hidden in their
bags would be a letter from Queen Elizabeth, proposing direct trade.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Eventually three adventurous traders were recruited to go,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>led by Roger
Symmes of the Levant Company. But Peter Elkington wanted a fourth, for
protection, and he eventually persuaded a young army captain of some reputation
to join the party. The captain—originally a painter, who had later turned
soldier after the death of his wife—was vigorous, spirited, and a deadly
marksman. Peter Elkington promised him a nobleman's fortune if they succeeded.
And he promised to take responsibility for Captain Hawksworth's eight-year-old
son, Brian, if they failed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Peter Elkington himself came down to the Thames that cold,
gray February dawn they set sail, bringing along his own son, George—a pudgy,
pampered adolescent in a silk doublet. Young George Elkington regally ignored
Brian Hawksworth, a snub only one of the two still remembered. As the sails
slowly dissolved into the icy mist, Brian climbed atop his uncle's shoulders to
catch a long last glimpse. No one dreamed that only one of the four would ever
see London again.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Letters smuggled back in cipher kept the Levant Company
informed of progress. The party reached Tripoli without incident, made their
way successfully overland through Arabia, and then hired passage on an Arab
trader for her trip down the Persian Gulf. The plan seemed to be working
perfectly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then came a final letter, from the Portuguese fortress of
Hormuz, a salt-covered island peopled by traders, overlooking the straits
between the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman, gateway to the Arabian Sea and
India's ports. While waiting at Hormuz for passage on to India, the English
party had been betrayed by a suspicious Venetian and accused of being spies.
The Portuguese governor of Hormuz had nervously imprisoned them and decreed
they be shipped to Goa for trial.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>After waiting a few more months for further word, Peter
Elkington finally summoned Brian Hawksworth to the offices of the Levant
Company and read him this last letter. He then proceeded to curse the contract
with Captain Hawksworth that rendered the Levant Company responsible for
Brian's education should the expedition meet disaster.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Peter Elkington admitted his plan had failed, and with that
admission, the Levant Company quietly abandoned its vision of direct trade with
India.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But Brian Hawksworth now had a private tutor, engaged by the
Levant Company, a tousle-haired young apostate recently dismissed from his post
at Eton for his anti-religious views.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>This new tutor scorned as dogmatic the accepted subjects of
Latin, rhetoric, and Hebrew—all intended to help Elizabethan scholars fathom
abstruse theological disputations—and insisted instead on mathematics, and the
new subject of science. His anti-clerical outlook also meant he would teach
none of the German in fashion with the Puritans, or the French and Spanish
favored by Catholics. For him all that mattered was classical Greek: the
language of logic, pure philosophy, mathematics, and science. The end result
was that the commoner Brian Hawksworth received an education far different
from, if not better than, that of most gentlemen, and one that greatly
surpassed the hornbook alphabet and numbers that passed for learning among
others of his own class.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>To no one's surprise, Brian Hawksworth was his father's son,
and he took naturally to marksmanship and fencing. But his first love came to
be the English lute, his escape from the world of his tutor's hard numbers and
theorems.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It lasted until the day he was fourteen, the day the Levant
Company's responsibility expired. The next morning Brian Hawksworth found
himself apprenticed to a Thames waterman and placed in service on one of the
mud-encrusted ferryboats that plied London's main artery. After three months of
misery and ill pay, he slipped away to take a berth on a North Sea merchantman.
There he sensed at once his calling was the sea, and he also discovered his
knowledge of mathematics gave him an understanding of navigation few other
seamen enjoyed. By then he scarcely remembered his father, or the luckless
expedition to India.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Until the day Roger Symmes appeared alone back in London,
almost ten years after that icy morning the Levant Company's expedition had sailed.
. . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The <i>Discovery </i>groaned, and Hawksworth sensed the wind
freshen as it whipped through the stern quarter gallery and noticed the
increasingly brisk swirl of the tide. Almost time to cast off. As he made his
way back to the Great Cabin for a last check, his thoughts returned again to
London, those many years ago.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He had found Symmes at the offices of the Levant Company,
nursing a tankard of ale as he sat very close to their large roaring fireplace.
He bore little resemblance to the jaunty adventurer Hawksworth remembered from
that long-ago morning on the Thames. Now he was an incongruous figure, costumed
in a tight-fitting new silk doublet and wearing several large gold rings, yet
with a face that was haggard beyond anything Hawksworth had ever seen. His
vacant eyes seemed unable to focus as he glanced up briefly and then returned
his stare to the crackling logs in the hearth. But he needed no prompting to
begin his story.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Aye, 'tis a tale to make the blood run ice.&quot;
Symmes eased open a button of his ornate doublet and shakily loosened his new
ruff collar. &quot;After the Venetian rogue gets us arrest'd with his damnable
lie, the bastard Portugals clap us in the hold of a coastin' barge makin' for
Goa, in company with near a hundred Arab horses. When we finally make port,
they haul us out of that stink hole and slam us in another, this time the
Viceroy's dungeons. We took ourselves for dead men.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But what happened to my father?&quot; Hawksworth
blinked the sweat from his eyes, wanting the story but wanting almost more to
escape the overheated, timbered offices that loomed so alien.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That's the horrible part o' the story. It happen'd the
next mornin', poor luckless bastard. We're all march'd into this big
stone-floor'd room where they keep the <i>strappado</i>.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What's that?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;Tis a kindly little invention o' the
Portugals, lad. First they bind your hands behind your back and run the rope up
over a hangin' pulley block. Then they hoist you up in the air and set to
givin' it little tugs, makin' you hop like you're dancin' the French lavolta.
When they tire o' the sport, or they're due to go say their rosary beads, they
just give it a good strong heave and pop your arms out o' your shoulders.
Jesuits claim 'twould make a Moor pray to the pope.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth found himself watching Symmes's wild eyes as he
recounted the story, and wondering how he could remember every detail of events
a decade past.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then this young captain comes in, struttin' bastard,
hardly a good twenty year on him. Later I made a point to learn his name—Vaijantes,
Miguel Vaijantes.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What did he do?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Had to see him, lad. Eyes black and hard as onyx. An'
he sports this sword he's had made up with rubies in the handle. Ne'er saw the
likes o' it, before or since, e'en in India. But he's a Portugal, tho', through
an' through. No doubt on that one.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But what did he do?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Why, he has the guards sling Hawksworth up in the <i>strappado</i>,
lad, seein' he's the strongest one o' us. Figur'd he'd last longer, I suppose,
make more sport.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Vaijantes had them torture my father?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Aye. Think's he'll squeeze a confession and be a hero.
But ol' Hawksworth ne'er said a word. All day. By nightfall Vaijantes has
pull'd his arms right out. They carried him out of the room a dead man.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth still remembered how his stomach turned at that
moment, with the final knowledge that his father was not merely missing, or
away—as he had told himself, and others—but had been coldly murdered. He had
checked his tears, lest Symmes see, and pressed on.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What happened to you, and to the others? Did he torture
you next?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Would have, not a doubt on't. We all wonder'd who'd be
the next one. Then that night they post a Jesuit down to our cell, a turncoat
Dutchman by the name of Huyghen, who spoke perfect English, thinkin' he'd cozen
us into confessin'.  But he hates the Portugals e'en more'n we do. An' he tells
us we'd most likely go free if we'd pretend to turn Papist. So the next day we
blurt out we're actually a band o' wealthy adventurers in disguise, rich lads
out to taste the world, but we've seen the error o' our ways an' we've decided
to foreswear the flesh and turn Jesuits ourselves. Thinkin' of donatin'
everything we own to their holy order.&quot; Symmes paused and nervously drew a
small sip from his tankard of spiced ale. &quot;Vicious Papist bastards.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Did they really believe you?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Guess the Dutchman must've convinc'd 'em somehow.
Anyway, our story look'd square enough to get us out on bail, there bein' no
evidence for the charge o' spyin' in any case. But we'd hardly took a breath of
air before our old friend the Hollander comes runnin' with news the Viceroy's
council just voted to ship us back to Lisbon for trial. That happens and we're
dead men. No question. We had to look to it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Symmes seemed to find concentration increasingly difficult,
but he extracted a long-stemmed pipe and began stuffing black strands into it
with a trembling hand while he composed himself. Finally he continued.
&quot;Had to leave Goa that very night. What else could we do? So we traded
what little we had for diamonds, sew'd 'em up in our clothes, and waded the
river into India. By dawn we're beyond reach o' the Portugals. In India. An'
then, lad, is when it began.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What happened?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;T’would take a year to tell it all. Somehow we
eventually got to the Great Moghul’s court. I think he was named Akman. An' we
start livin' like I never thought I'd see. Should've seen his city, lad, made
London look like a Shropshire village. He had a big red marble palace called
Fatehpur Sekri, with jewels common as rocks, an’ gold e'erywhere, an' gardens
filled with fountains, an' mystical music like I'd ne'er heard, an' dancin'
women that look'd like angels . . .&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>His voice trailed off. &quot;Ah, lad, the women there.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Symmes suddenly remembered himself and turned to examine
Hawksworth with his glassy eyes. &quot;But I fancy you're a bit young to
appreciate that part o' it, lad.&quot; Then his gaze returned to the fire and
he rambled on, warming to his own voice. &quot;An' there was poets readin'
Persian, and painters drawin' pictures that took days to do one the size of a
book page. An' the banquets, feasts you're ne'er like to see this side o'
Judgment Day.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Symmes paused to draw on his pipe for a moment, his hand
still shaking, and then he plunged ahead. &quot;But it was the Drugs that did
it, lad, what they call'd affion and bhang, made out o' poppy flowers and some
kind of hemp. Take enough of them and the world around you starts to get lost.
After a while you ne'er want to come back. It kill'd the others, lad. God only
knows how I escap'd.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then Symmes took up his well-rehearsed monologue about the
wealth he'd witnessed, stories of potential trade that had earned him a place
at many a merchant's table. His tale expanded, becoming ever more fantastic,
until it was impossible to tell where fact ended and wishful fabrication began.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Although Symmes had never actually met any Indian officials,
and though the letter from Queen Elizabeth had been lost en route, his
astonishing story of India's riches inspired the greed of all England's
merchants. Excitement swelled throughout London's Cheapside, as traders began
to clamor for England to challenge Portugal's monopoly of the sea passage
around the Cape. Symmes, by his inflated, half-imaginary account, had
unwittingly sown the first seeds of the East India Company.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Only young Brian Hawksworth, who nourished no mercantile
fantasies, seemed to realize that Roger Symmes had returned from India quite
completely mad.</span></p>

&quot;Pinnace is afloat, Cap'n. I'm thinkin' we should stow the goods and be

doorway of the Great Cabin, his eyes gaunt in the lantern light. Dark had
dropped suddenly over the <i>Discovery</i>, bringing with it a cooling respite
from the inferno of day.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We'll cast off before the watch is out. Start loading
the cloth and iron-work&quot;—Hawksworth turned and pointed toward his own

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Mackintosh backed through the doorway and turned
automatically to leave. But then he paused, his body suspended in uncertainty
for a long moment. Finally he revolved again to Hawksworth.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Have to tell you, I've a feelin' we'll na be sailin'
out o' this piss-hole alive.&quot; He squinted across the semi-dark of the
cabin. &quot;It's my nose tellin' me, sir, and she's always right.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The Company's sailed to the Indies twice before,
Mackintosh.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Aye, but na to India. The bleedin' Company ne'er
dropped anchor in this nest o' Portugals. 'Twas down to Java before. With
nothin' but a few Dutchmen to trouble o'er. India's na the Indies, Cap'n. The
Indies is down in the Spice Islands, where seas are open. The ports o' India
belong to the Portugals, sure as England owns the Straits o' Dover. So beggin'
your pardon, Cap'n, this is na the Indies. This might well be Lisbon
harbor.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We'll have a secure anchorage. And once we're inland
the Portugals can't touch us.&quot; Hawksworth tried to hold a tone of
confidence in his voice. &quot;The pilot says he can take us upriver tonight.
Under cover of dark.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;No Christian can trust a bleedin' Moor, Cap'n. An' this
one's got a curious look. Somethin' in his eyes. Can't tell if he's lookin' at
you or na.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth wanted to agree, but he stopped himself.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Moors just have their own ways, Mackintosh. Their mind
works differently. But I can already tell this one's not like the Turks.&quot;
Hawksworth still had not decided what he thought about the pilot. It scarcely
matters now, he told himself, we've no choice but to trust him. &quot;Whatever
he's thinking, he'll have no room to play us false.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Maybe na, but he keeps lookin' toward the shore. Like</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>he's
expectin' somethin'. The bastard's na tellin' us what he knows. I smell it. The
nose, Cap'n.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We'll have muskets, Mackintosh. And the cover of dark.
Now load the pinnace and let's be on with it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Mackintosh stared at the boards, shifting and tightening his
belt. He started to argue more, but Hawksworth's voice stopped him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And, Mackintosh, order the muskets primed with pistol
shot.&quot; Hawksworth recalled a trick his father had once told him about,
many long years past. &quot;If anybody ventures to surprise us, we'll hand them
a surprise in turn. A musket ball's useless in the dark of night, clump of
pistol shot at close quarters is another story.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The prospect of a fight seemed to transform Mackintosh. With
a grin he snapped alert, whirled, and stalked down the companionway toward the
main deck.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Moments later the balding purser appeared, a lifelong seaman
with an unctuous smile and rapacious eyes who had dispensed stores on many a
prosperous merchantman, and grown rich on a career of bribes. He mechanically
logged Hawksworth's chest in his account book and then signaled the bosun to
stow the heavy wooden trunk into the pinnace.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth watched the proceedings absently as he checked the
edge on his sword. Then he slipped the belt over his shoulder and secured its
large brass buckle. Finally he locked the stern windows and surveyed the
darkened cabin one last time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The <i>Discovery</i>. May God defend her and see us all home
safe. Every man.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then without looking back he firmly closed the heavy oak door,
latched it, and headed down the companionway toward the main deck.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Rolls of broadcloth lay stacked along the waist of the ship,
and beside them were muskets and a keg of powder. George Elkington was checking
off samples of cloth as they were loaded irto the pinnace, noting his selection
in a book of accounts.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Standing next to him, watching idly, was Humphrey Spencer,
youngest son of Sir Randolph Spencer. He had shipped the voyage as the
assistant to Elkington, but his real motivation was not commerce but adventure,
and a stock of tales to spin out in taverns when he returned. His face of
twenty had suffered little from the voyage, for a stream of bribes to the
knowing purser had reserved for him the choice provisions, including virtually
all the honey and raisins.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Humphrey Spencer had donned a tall, brimmed hat, a feather
protruding from its beaver band, and his fresh doublet of green taffeta fairly
glowed in the lantern's rays. His new thigh-length hose were an immaculate tan
and his ruff collar pure silk. A bouquet of perfume hovered about him like an
invisible cloud.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Spencer turned and began to pace the deck in distraught
agitation, oblivious to his interference as weary seamen worked around him to
drag rolls of broadcloth next to the gunwales, stacking them for others to
hoist and stow in the pinnace. Then he spotted Hawksworth, and his eyes
brightened.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Captain, at last you're here. Your bosun is an arrant
knave, my life on't. He'll not have these rogues stow my chest.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;There's no room in the pinnace for your chest,
Spencer.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But how'm I to conduct affairs 'mongst the Moors
without a gentleman's fittings?&quot; He reviewed Hawksworth's leather jerkin
and seaboots with disdain.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Before Hawksworth could reply, Elkington was pulling himself
erect, wincing at the gout as his eyes blazed. &quot;Spencer, you've enough to
do just mindin' the accounts, which thus far you've shown scant aptness
for.&quot; He turned and spat into the scuppers. &quot;Your father'd have me
make you a merchant, but methinks I'd sooner school an ape to sing. 'Tis
tradin' we're here for, not to preen like a damn'd coxcomb. Now look to
it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You'll accompany us, Spencer, as is your charge.&quot;
Hawksworth walked past the young clerk, headed for the fo'c'sle. &quot;The only
'fittings' you'll need are a sword and musket, which I dearly hope you know
enough to use. Now prepare to board.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As Hawksworth passed the mainmast, bosun's mate John</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Garway
dropped the bundle he was holding and stepped forward, beaming a toothless
smile.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Beggin' your pardon, Cap'n. Might I be havin' a
word?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What is it, Garway.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Would you ask the heathen, sir, for the men? We've been
wonderin' if there's like to be an alehouse or such in this place we're goin'.
An' a few o' the kindly sex what might be friendly disposed, if you follow my
reckonin', sir.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth looked up and saw Karim waiting by the fo'c'sle,
his effects rolled in a small woven tapestry under his arm. When the question
was translated, the pilot laid aside the bundle and stepped toward the group of
waiting seamen, who had all stopped work to listen. He studied them for a
moment—ragged and rank with sweat, their faces blotched with scurvy and their
hair matted with grease and lice—and smiled with expressionless eyes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Your men will find they can purchase <i>arak</i>, a
local liquor as potent as any I have seen from Europe. And the public women of
Surat are masters of all refinements of the senses. They are exquisite, worthy
even of the Moghul himself. Accomplished women of pleasure have been brought
here from all civilized parts of the world, even Egypt and Persia. I'm sure
your seamen will find the accommodations of Surat worthy of their
expectations.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth translated the reply and a cheer rose from the
men.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Hear that, mates?&quot; Master's mate Thomas Davies
turned to the crowd, his face a haggard leer. &quot;Let the rottin' Portugals
swab cannon in hell. I'll be aswim in grog an' snuffin' my wick with a willin'
wench. Heathen or no, 'tis all one, what say?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>A confirming hurrah lifted from the decks and the men resumed
their labor with spirits noticeably replenished.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth turned and ascended the companionway ladder to the
quarterdeck, leaving behind the tense bravado. As he surveyed the deck below
from his new vantage, he suddenly sensed an eerie light enveloping the chip, a
curious glow that seemed almost to heighten the pensive lament of the boards
and the lulling melody of wind through the rigging. Then he realized why.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The moon!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I'd forgotten. Or was I too tired to think? But now . . .
it's almost like daylight. God help us, we've lost the last of our luck.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Ready to cast off.&quot; Mackintosh mounted the
companionway to the quarterdeck, his face now drawn deep with fatigue.
&quot;Shall I board the men?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth turned with a nod, and followed him down to the
main deck.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Oarsmen began scrambling down the side of the <i>Discovery</i>,
a motley host, shoeless and clad only in powder- smudged breeches. Though a
rope ladder dangled from the gunwales, the seamen preferred to grasp the
dead-eyes, easing themselves onto the raised gunport lids, and from there
dropping the last few feet into the pinnace. They were followed by George
Elkington, who lowered himself down the swaying ladder, breathing oaths.
Hawksworth lingered by the railing, searching the moonlit horizon and the
darkened coast. His senses quickened as he probed for some clue that would
trigger an advance alert. But the moonlit water's edge lay barren, deserted
save for an occasional beached fishing skiff, its sisal nets exposed on poles
to dry. Why the emptiness? During the day there were people.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then he sensed Karim standing beside him, also intent on the
empty shore. The pilot's back was to the lantern that swung from the mainmast
and his face was shrouded in shadow. Abruptly, he addressed Hawksworth in
Turki.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The face of India glories in the moonlight, do you
agree? It is beautiful, and lies at peace.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You're right about the beauty. It could almost be the
coast of Wales.&quot; Hawksworth thought he sensed a powerful presence about
Karim now, something he could not explain, only detect with a troubled
intuition. Then the pilot spoke again.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Have you prepared yourself to meet the
Shahbandar?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We're ready. We have samples of English goods. And I'm
an ambassador from King James. There's no reason to deny us entry.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I told you he is a man of importance. And he already
knows, as all who matter will soon know, of your exceptional fortune today. Do
you really think today's battle will go unnoticed in India?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I think the Portugals noticed. And I know they'll be
back. But with luck we'll manage.&quot; Hawksworth felt the muscles in his
throat tighten involuntarily, knowing a fleet of warships from Goa would
probably be headed north within a fortnight.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;No, Captain, again you miss my meaning.&quot; Karim
turned to draw closer to Hawksworth, flashing a joyless smile. &quot;I speak of
India. Not the Portuguese. They are nothing. Yes, they trouble our seas, but
they are nothing. They do not rule India. Do you understand?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth stiffened, unsure how to respond. &quot;I know the
Moghul rules India. And that he'll have to wonder if the damned Portugals are
still master of his seas.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Surely you realize, Captain, that the Portuguese's
profits are staggering. Are you also aware these profits are shared with
certain persons of importance in India?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You mean the Portugals have bribed officials?&quot;
That's nothing new, Hawksworth thought. &quot;Who? The Shahbandar?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Let us say they often give commissions.&quot; Karim
waved his hand as though administering a dispensation. &quot;But there are
others whom they allow to invest directly in their trade. The profits give
these persons power they often do not use wisely.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Are you telling me the Moghul himself invests with the
damned Portugals?&quot; Hawksworth's hopes plummeted.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;On the contrary. His Majesty is an honorable man, and a
simple man who knows but little of what some do in his name. But do you
understand there must be one in his realm who will someday have his place?
Remember he is mortal. He rules like a god, but he is mortal.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What does this have to do with the Shahbandar? Surely
he'd not challenge the Moghul. And I know the Moghul has sons . . .&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Of course, he is not the one.&quot; Karim's smile was
gentle. &quot;But do not forget the Shahbandar is powerful, more powerful than
most realize. He knows all that happens in India, for his many friends repay
their obligation to him with knowledge. As for you, if he judges your wisdom
worthy of your fortune today, he may choose to aid you. Your journey to Agra
will not be without peril. There are already those in India who will not wish
you there. Perhaps the Shahbandar can give you guidance. It will be for him to
decide.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth studied Karim incredulously. How could he know?
&quot;Whatever I may find necessary to do, it will not involve a port official
like the Shahbandar. And a trip to Agra surely would not require his
approval.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But you must find your way.&quot; Karim examined
Hawksworth with a quick sidelong glance, realizing he had guessed correctly.
&quot;My friend, your defeat of the Portuguese today may have implications you
do not realize. But at times you talk as a fool, even more than the Portuguese.
You will need a guide on your journey. Believe me when I tell you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Karim paused for a moment to examine Hawksworth, as though
wondering how to couch his next words. &quot;Perhaps you should let the stars
guide you. In the Holy Quran the Prophet has said of Allah, 'And he hath set
for you the stars’ . . .”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;'That you may guide your course by them.&quot;'
Hawksworth picked up the verse, &quot;'Amid the dark of land and sea.' Yes, I
learned that verse in Tunis. And I knew already a seaman steers by the stars.
But I don't understand what bearing that has on a journey to Agra.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Just as I begin to think you have wisdom, again you
cease to listen. But I think now you will remember what I have said.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Hawksworth!&quot; Elkington's voice boomed from the
pinnace below. &quot;Have we sail'd a blessed seven month to this nest o'
heathens so's to idle about and palaver?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth turned to see Humphrey Spencer gingerly lowering
himself down the ladder into the pinnace, the feather in his hatband whipping in
the night wind. The oarsmen were at their stations, ready.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;One thing more, Captain.&quot; Karim pressed a hand
against Hawksworth's arm, holding him back. &quot;One thing more I will tell
you. Many <i>feringhi</i>, foreigners, who come to India are very unwise.
Because our women keep the veil, and dwell indoors, foreigners assume they have
no power, no influence. Do not act as other foolish <i>feringhi </i>and make
this mistake. In Surat . . .&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What women do you mean? The wives of officials?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Please, listen. When you reach Surat, remember one last
admonition from the Quran. There it is written, 'As for women from whom you
fear rebellion, admonish them and banish them to beds apart.' But sometimes a
woman too can be strong-willed. She can be the one who banishes her husband, denying
him his rights. If she is important, there is nothing he can do. Remember. .
.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Damn it to hell,&quot; Elkington's voice roared again,
&quot;I'm not likin' these moonlight ventures. Tis full risk aplenty when you
can see who's holdin' a knife to your throat. But if we're goin', I say let's
be done with it and have off.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth turned back to Karim, but he was gone, swinging
himself lightly over the side of the <i>Discovery </i>and into the pinnace.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Across the moonlight-drenched swells the <i>Resolve</i>
lay quiet, her stern lantern reassuringly aglow, ready to hoist sail for the
cove. And on the <i>Discovery</i> seamen were at station, poised to follow.
Hawksworth looked once more toward the abandoned shore, troubled, and then
dropped quickly down the side into the pinnace. There was no sound now, only
the cadence of the boards as the <i>Discovery's </i>anchor chain argued against
the tide. And then a dull thud as the mooring line dropped onto the floor
planking of the pinnace.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth ordered Mackintosh to row with the tide until they
reached the shelter of the river mouth, and then to ship the oars and hoist
sail if the breeze held. He had picked the ablest men as oarsmen, those not
wounded and least touched by scurvy, and next to each lay a heavy cutlass. He
watched Mackintosh in admiration as the quartermaster effortlessly maneuvered
the tiller with one hand and directed the oarsmen with the other. The moon was
even more alive now, glinting off the Scotsman's red hair.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As the hypnotic rhythm of the oars lulled Hawksworth's mind, he
felt a growing tiredness begin to beg at his senses. Against his will he
started to drift, to follow the moonlight's dancing, prismatic tinge on the
moving crest of waves. And to puzzle over what lay ahead.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Half-dozing, he found his thoughts drawn to the Shahbandar
who waited in Surat, almost like a gatekeeper who held the keys to India. He
mulled Karim's words again, the hints of what would unlock that doorway, and
slowly his waking mind drifted out of reach. He passed unknowing into that
dreamlike state where deepest truth so often lies waiting, unknown to
rationality. And there, somehow, the pilot's words made perfect sense . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Permission to hoist the sail.&quot; Mackintosh cut the
pinnace into the river mouth, holding to the center of the channel. Hawksworth
startled momentarily at the voice, then forced himself alert and scanned the
dark riverbanks. There was still nothing. He nodded to Mackintosh and watched
as the sail slipped quietly up the mast. Soon the wind and tide were carrying
them swiftly, silently. As he watched the run of the tide against the hull, he
suddenly noticed a group of round objects, deep red, bobbing past.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Karim.&quot; Hawksworth drew his sword and pointed
toward one of the balls. &quot;What are those?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;A fruit of our country, Captain. The <i>topiwallahs </i>call
them ‘coconuts.’&quot; Karim's voice was scarcely above a whisper, and his eyes
left the shore for only a moment. &quot;They are the last remains of the August
festival.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What festival is that?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The celebration of the Hindu traders. Marking the end
of the monsoon and the opening of the Tapti River to trade. Hindus at Surat
smear coconuts with vermilion and cast them into the Tapti, believing this will
appease the angry life-force of the sea. They also cover barges with flowers
and span them across the harbor. If you were there, you would hear them play
their music and chant songs to their heathen gods.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And the coconuts eventually float out to sea?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;A few, yes. But mostly they are stolen by wicked boys,
who swim after them. These few perhaps their gods saved for themselves.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth examined the bobbing balls anew. The coconut was
yet another legend of the Indies. Stories passed that a man could live for days
on the liquor sealed within its straw-matted shell.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The moon chased random clouds, but still the riverbank was
illuminated like day. The damp air was still, amplifying the music of the
night—the buzz of gnats, the call of night birds, even the occasional trumpet
of a distant elephant, pierced the solid wood line on either side of the narrowing
river. Hawksworth tasted the dark, alert, troubled. Where are the human sounds?
Where are the barges I saw plying the river mouth during the day? I sense an
uneasiness in the pilot, an alarm he does not wish me to see. Damn the moon. If
only we had dark.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Karim.&quot; Hawksworth spoke softly, his eyes never
long from the dense rampart of trees along the riverbank.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What do you wish, Captain?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Have you ever traveled up the river before by
moonlight?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Once, yes, many years ago. When I was young and burning
for a woman after our ship had dropped anchor in the bay. I was only a <i>karwa</i>
then, a common seaman, and I thought I would not be missed. I was wrong. The <i>nakuda</i>
discovered me in Surat and reclaimed my wage for the entire voyage. It was a
very hungry time.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Was the river quiet then, as it is now?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Yes, Captain, just the same.&quot; Though Karim looked
at him directly, the darkness still guarded his eyes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Mackintosh.&quot; Hawksworth's voice cut the silence.
&quot;Issue the muskets.&quot; His eyes swept along the shore, and then to the
narrow bend they were fast approaching. Karim is lying, he told himself; at
last the pilot has begun to play false with us. Why? What does he fear?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Aye aye, Cap'n.&quot; Mackintosh was instantly alert.
&quot;What do you see?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The sudden voices startled Elkington awake, and his nodding
head snapped erect. &quot;The damn'd Moors have settl'd in for the night. If
you'd hold your peace, I could join 'em. I'll need the full o' my wits for
hagglin' with that subtle lot o' thieves come the morrow. There's no Portugals.
E'en the night birds are quiet as mice.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Precisely,&quot; Hawksworth shot back. &quot;And I
would thank you to take a musket, and note its flintlock is full-cocked and the
flashpan dry.&quot; Then he continued, &quot;Mackintosh, strike the sail. And,
Karim, take the tiller.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The pinnace was a sudden burst of activity, as seamen quickly
hauled in the sail and began to check the prime on their flintlocks. With the
sail lashed, their view was unobstructed in all directions. The tide rushing
through the narrows of the approaching bend carried the pinnace ever more
rapidly, and now only occasional help was needed from the oarsmen to keep it
aright.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>A cloud drifted over the moon, and for an instant the river
turned black. Hawksworth searched the darkness ahead, silent, waiting. Then he
saw it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>      
“On the boards!”</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>A blaze of musket fire spanned the river ahead, illuminating
the blockade of longboats. Balls sang into the water around them while others
splattered off the side of the pinnace or hissed past the mast. Then the returning
moon glinted off the silver helmets of the Portuguese infantry.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As Karim instinctively cut the pinnace toward the shore,
Portuguese longboats maneuvered easily toward them, muskets spewing sporadic
flame. The English oarsmen positioned themselves to return the fire, but
Hawksworth stopped them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Not yet, he told himself, we'll have no chance to reload. The
first round has to count. And damn my thoughtlessness, for not bringing pikes.
We could have . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The pinnace lurched crazily and careened sideways, hurtling
around broadside to the longboats.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>A sandbar. We've struck a damned sandbar. But we've got to
face them with the prow. Otherwise . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As though sensing Hawksworth's thoughts, Karim seized</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>an oar and
began to pole the pinnace's stern off the bar. Slowly it eased around, coming
about to face the approaching longboats. No sooner had the pinnace righted
itself than the first longboat glanced off the side of the bow, and a grapple
caught their gunwale.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then the first Portuguese soldier leaped aboard—and doubled
in a flame of sparks as Mackintosh shoved a musket into his belly and pulled
the trigger. As the other English muskets spoke out in a spray of pistol shot,
several Portuguese in the longboat pitched forward, writhing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Mackintosh began to bark commands for reloading.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Half-cock your muskets. Wipe your pans. Handle your
primers. Cast about to charge . . .&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But time had run out. Two more longboats bracketed each side
of the bow. And now Portuguese were piling aboard.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Damn the muskets,&quot; Hawksworth yelled. &quot;Take
your swords.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The night air came alive with the sound of steel against
steel, while each side taunted the other with unintelligible obscenities. The
English were outnumbered many to one, and slowly they found themselves being
driven to the stern of the pinnace. Still more Portuguese poured aboard now, as
the pinnace groaned against the sand.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth kept to the front of his men, matching the poorly
trained Portuguese infantry easily. Thank God there's no more foot room, he
thought, we can almost stand them man for man . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>At that moment two Portuguese pinned Hawksworth's sword
against the mast, allowing a third to gain footing and lunge. As Hawksworth
swerved to avoid the thrust, his foot crashed through the thin planking
covering the keel, bringing him down. Mackintosh yelled a warning and leaped
forward, slashing the first soldier through the waist and sending him to the
bottom of the pinnace, moaning. Then the quartermaster seized the other man by
the throat and, lunging like a bull, whipped him against the mast, snapping his
neck.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth groped blindly for his sword and watched as the
third soldier poised for a mortal sweep. Where is it?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>       Good
God, he'll cut me in half.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Suddenly he felt a cold metal object pressed against his hand,
and above the din he caught Humphrey Spencer's high-pitched voice, urging. It
was a pocket pistol.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Did he prime it? Does he know how?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As the Portuguese soldier began his swing, Hawksworth raised
the pistol and squeezed. There was a dull snap, a hiss, and then a blaze that
melted the soldier's face into red.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He flung the pistol aside and seized the dying Portuguese's
sword. He was armed again, but there was little advantage left. Slowly the
English were crowded into a huddle of the stern. Cornered, abaft the mast, they
no longer had room to parry. Hawksworth watched in horror as a burly
Portuguese, his silver helmet askew, braced himself against the mast and drew
back his sword to send a swath through the English. Hawksworth tried to set a
parry, but his arms were pinned.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He'll kill half the men. The bastard will . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>A bemused expression unexpectedly illuminated the soldier's
face, a smile with no mirth. In an instant it transmuted to disbelief, while
his raised sword clattered to the planking. As Hawksworth watched, the
Portuguese's hand began to work mechanically at his chest. Then his helmet
tumbled away, and he slumped forward, motionless but still erect. He stood
limp, head cocked sideways, as though distracted during prayer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Why doesn't he move? Was this all some bizarre, senseless
jest?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then Hawksworth saw the arrows. A neat row of thin bamboo
shafts had pierced the soldier's Portuguese armor, riveting him to the mast.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>A low-pitched hum swallowed the sudden silence, as volleys of
bamboo arrows sang from the darkness of the shore. Measured, deadly. Hawksworth
watched in disbelief as one by one the Portuguese soldiers around them
crumpled, a few firing wildly into the night. In what seemed only moments it
was over, the air a cacophony of screams and moaning death.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth turned to Karim, noting fright in the pilot's eyes
for the very first time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The arrows.&quot; He finally found his voice.
&quot;Whose are they?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I can probably tell you.&quot; The pilot stepped
forward and deftly broke away the feathered tip on one of the shafts still
holding the Portuguese to the mast. As he did so, the other arrows snapped and
the Portuguese slumped against the gunwale, then slipped over the side and into
the dark water. Karim watched him disappear, then raised the arrow to the moonlight.
For an instant Hawksworth thought he saw a quizzical look enter the pilot's
eyes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Before he could speak, lines of fire shot across the surface
of the water, as fire arrows came, slamming into the longboats as they drifted
away on the tide. Streak after streak found the hulls and in moments they were
torches. In the flickering light, Hawksworth could make out what seemed to be
grapples, flashing from the shore, pulling the floating bodies of the dead and
dying to anonymity. He watched spellbound for a moment, then turned again
toward the stern.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Karim, I asked whose arrows . . .&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The pilot was gone. Only the English seamen remained, dazed
and uncomprehending.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then the night fell suddenly silent once more, save for the
slap of the running tide against the hull.</span></p>

<h2><a name=bookmark6>CHAPTER FIVE</a></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>         The
room was musty and close, as though the rainy season had not passed, and the
floor was hard mud. Through crude wooden shutters they could glimpse the early
sun stoking anew for the day's inferno, but now it merely washed the earthen
walls in stripes of golden light.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth stood by the window examining the grassy square
that spanned out toward the river. The porters, in whose lodge they were
confined, milled about the open area, chanting and sweating as they unloaded
large bales of cotton from the two-wheeled bullock carts that continually
rolled into the square. He steadied himself against the heavy wooden frame of
the window and wondered if his land legs would return before the day was out.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;God curse all Moors.&quot; Mackintosh stooped over the
tray resting on the grease-smudged center carpet and pulled a lid from one of
the earthen bowls. He stared critically at the dense, milky liquid inside, then
gingerly dipped in a finger and took a portion to his lips. He tested the
substance—tangy curds smelling faintly of spice—and his face hardened.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Tis damned spoilt milk.&quot; He spat fiercely onto the
carpet and seized a piece of fried bread to purge the taste. &quot;Fitter for
swine than men.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What'd they do with the samples?&quot; Elkington
sprawled heavily in the corner, his eyes bloodshot from the all-night vigil
upriver. &quot;With no guards the heathens'll be thievin' the lot.&quot; He
squinted toward the window, but made no effort to move. His exhaustion and
despair were total.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The goods are still where they unloaded them.&quot;
Hawksworth revolved toward the room. &quot;They say nothing happens till the
Shahbandar arrives.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What'd they say about him?&quot; Elkington slowly drew
himself to his feet.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;They said he arrives at mid morning, verifies his seal
on the customs house door, and then orders it opened. They also said that all
traders must be searched personally by his officers. He imposes duty on
everything, right down to the shillings in your pocket.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Damn'd if I'll pay duty. Not for samples.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That's what I said. And they ignored me. It seems to be
law.&quot; Hawksworth noticed that the gold was dissolving from the dawn sky,
surrendering to a brilliant azure. He turned, scooped a portion of curds onto a
piece of fried bread, and silently chewed as he puzzled over the morning. And
the night before.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Who had saved them? And why? Did someone in India hate the
Portuguese so much they would defend the English before even knowing who they
were? No one in India could know about King James's letter, about the East
India Company's plans. No one. Even George Elkington did not know everything.
Yet someone in India already wanted the English alive. He had wrestled with the
question for the rest of the trip upriver, and he could think of no answers.
They had been saved for a reason, a reason he did not know, and that worried
him even more than the Portuguese.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Without a pilot they had had to probe upriver slowly,
sounding for sandbars with an oar. Finally, when they were near exhaustion, the
river suddenly curved and widened. Then, in the first dim light of morning,
they caught the unmistakable outlines of a harbor. It had to be Surat. The
river lay north-south now, with the main city sprawled along its eastern shore.
The tide began to fall back, depleted, and he realized they had timed its flow
perfectly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As they waited for dawn, the port slowly revealed itself in
the eastern glow. Long stone steps emerged directly from the Tapti River and
broadened into a wide, airy square flanked on three sides by massive stone
buildings. The structure on the downriver side was obviously a fortress, built
square with a large turret at each corner, and along the top of walls
Hawksworth could see the muzzles of cannon—they looked to be eight-inchers—trained
directly on the water. And in the waning dark he spotted tiny points of light,
spaced regularly along the top of the fortress walls. That could only mean one
thing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Mackintosh, ship the oars and drop anchor. We can't
dock until daylight.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Aye, Cap'n, but why not take her in now? We can see to
make a landin'.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And they can see us well enough to position their
cannon. Look carefully along there.&quot; Hawksworth directed his gaze toward
the top of the fortress. &quot;They've lighted linstocks for the guns.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Mother of God! Do they think we're goin' to storm their
bleedin' harbor with a pinnace?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Probably a standard precaution. But if we hold here, at
least we'll keep at the edge of their range. And we'd better put all weapons
out of sight. I want them to see a pinnace of friendly traders at sunup.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The dawn opened quickly, and as they watched, the square
blossomed to life. Large two-wheeled carts appeared through the half-dark,
drawn by muscular black oxen, some of whose horns had been tipped in silver.
One by one the oxen lumbered into the square, urged forward by the shouts and
beatings of turbaned drivers who wore folded white skirts instead of breeches.
Small fires were kindled by some of the men, and the unmistakable scent of
glowing dung chips savored the dark clouds of smoke that drifted out across the
river's surface.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then Hawksworth first noticed the bathers that had appeared
along the shore on either side of the stone steps: brown men stripped to
loincloths and women in brilliantly colored head-to-toe wraps were easing
themselves ceremoniously into the chilled, mud-colored water, some bowing
repeatedly in the direction of the rising sun. Only the waters fronting the
stairway remained unobstructed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>When the dawn sky had lightened to a muted red, Hawksworth decided
to start their move. He surveyed the men crowded in the pinnace one last time,
and read in some faces expectation and in others fear. But in all there was
bone-deep fatigue. Only Elkington seemed fully absorbed in the vision that lay
before them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Even from their distance the Chief Merchant was already
assessing the goods being unloaded from the carts: rolls of brown cloth,
bundles of indigo, and bales of combed cotton fiber. He would point, then turn
and gesture excitedly as he lectured Spencer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The young clerk was now a bedraggled remnant of fashion in
the powder-smudged remains of his new doublet. The plumed hat he had worn as
they cast off had been lost in the attack downriver, and now he crouched in the
bottom of the pinnace, humiliated and morose, his eyes vacant.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Mackintosh, weigh anchor. We'll row to the steps.
Slowly.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The men bobbed alert as they hoisted the chain into the prow
of the pinnace. Oars were slipped noisily into their rowlocks and Mackintosh
signaled to get underway.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As they approached the stairway, alarmed cries suddenly arose
from the sentinels stationed on stone platforms flanking either side of the
steps. In moments a crowd collected along the river, with turbaned men shouting
in a language Hawksworth could not place and gesturing the pinnace away from
the dock. What could they want, he asked himself? Who are they? They're not
armed. They don't look hostile. Just upset.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Permission to land.&quot; Hawksworth shouted to them in
Turkish, his voice slicing through the din and throwing a sudden silence over
the crowd.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The customs house does not open until two hours before
midday,&quot; a tall, bearded man shouted back. Then he squinted toward the
pinnace. &quot;Who are you? Portuguese?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;No, we're English.&quot; So that's it, Hawksworth
thought. They assumed we were Portugals with a boatload of booty. Here for a
bit of private trade.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The man examined the pinnace in confusion. Then he shouted
again over the waters.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You are not Portuguese?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I told you we're English.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Only Portuguese <i>topiwallahs</i> are allowed to
trade.&quot; The man was now scrutinizing the pinnace in open perplexity.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We've no goods for trade. Only samples.&quot;
Hawksworth tried to think of a way to confound the bureaucratic mind. &quot;We
only want food and drink.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You cannot land at this hour.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;In name of Allah, the Merciful.&quot; Hawksworth
stretched for his final ploy, invocation of that hospitality underlying all
Islamic life. Demands can be ignored. A traveler's need, never. &quot;Food and
drink for my men.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Miraculously, it seemed to work. The bearded man stopped
short and examined them again closely. Then he turned and dictated rapidly to
the group of waiting porters. In moments the men had plunged into the chilled
morning water, calling for the mooring line of the pinnace. As they towed the
pinnace into the shallows near the steps, other porters swarmed about the boat
and gestured to indicate the English should climb over the gunwales and be
carried ashore.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>They caught hold of George Elkington first. He clung futilely
to the gunwales as he was dragged cursing from the bobbing pinnace and hoisted
on the backs of two small Indian men. Arms flailing, he toppled himself from
their grasp and splashed backward into the muddy Tapti. After he floated to the
surface, sputtering, he was dragged bodily from the water and up the steps.
Then the others were carried ashore, and only Mackintosh tried to protest.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The last to leave the pinnace, Hawksworth hoisted himself off
the prow and onto the back of a wiry Indian whose thin limbs belied their
strength. The man's turban smelled faintly of sweat, but his well-worn shirt
was spotless. His dark eyes assessed Hawksworth with a practiced sidelong
glance, evaluating his attire, his importance, and the approximate cash value
of his sword in a single sweep.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Only after the porters had deposited them on the stone steps
did Hawksworth finally realize that India's best port had no wharf, that human
backs served as the loading platform for all men and goods. As he looked
around, he also noticed they had been surrounded by a crowd of men, not
identified by turbans as were the porters but uniformed more expensively and
wielding long, heavy canes. Wordlessly, automatically, the men aligned
themselves in two rows to create a protected pathway leading up the steps and
into the square. Hawksworth watched as they beat back the gathering crowd of
onlookers with their canes, and he suddenly understood this was how the port
prevented traders from passing valuables to an accomplice in the crowd and
circumventing customs.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then the tall bearded man approached Hawksworth, smiled
professionally, and bowed in the manner of Karim, hands together at the brow.
&quot;You are welcome in the name of the Shahbandar, as a guest only, not as a
trader.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Without further greeting he directed them across the open
square toward a small stone building. &quot;You will wait in the porters' lodge
until the customs house opens.&quot; As he ordered the heavy wooden door
opened, he curtly added, &quot;The Shahbandar will rule whether your presence
here is permitted.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He had watched them enter, and then he was gone. Shortly
after, the food had appeared.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth examined the room once more, its close air still
damp with the chill of dawn. The walls were squared, and the ceiling high and
arched. In a back corner a niche had been created, and in it rested a small
round stone pillar, presumably a religious object but one Hawksworth did not
recognize. Who would venerate a column of stone, he mused, particularly one
which seems almost like a man's organ? It can't be the Muslims. They worship
their own organs like no other race, but they generally honor their law against
icons. So it must be for the gentiles, the Hindus. Which means that the porters
are Hindus and their overseers Moors. That's the privilege of conquerors. Just
like every other land the Moors have seized by the sword.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He glanced again at the tray and noted that the food had been
completely devoured, consumed by ravenous seamen who would have scorned to
touch milk curds six months before. After a moment's consideration, Hawksworth
turned and seated himself on the edge of the carpet. There's nothing to be
done. We may as well rest while we have the chance.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>George Elkington had rolled himself in a corner of the</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>carpet and
now he dozed fitfully. Humphrey Spencer fought sleep as he worked vainly to
brush away the powder smudges from his doublet. Mackintosh had finished
whetting his seaman's knife and now sat absorbed in searching his hair for
lice. Bosun's mate John Garway lounged against a side wall, idly scratching his
codpiece and dreaming of the women he would soon have, his toothless smile
fixed in sleepy anticipation. The master's mate, Thomas Davies, dozed in a heap
by the door, his narrow face depleted and aged with scurvy. In a back corner
dice and a pile of coins had miraculously appeared, and the other seamen
sprawled about them on the floor, bloodshot eyes focused on the chance numbers
that would spell the longest splurge in port. Hawksworth stretched his wounded
leg once more, leaned stiffly against the front wall, and forced his mind to
drift again into needed rest.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth was suddenly alert, his senses troubled. The sun
had reached midmorning now, and it washed the mud floor in brilliant yellow
light. He sensed that a heavy shadow had passed through its beam. He had not
specifically seen it, but somehow, intuitively, he knew. Without a word he
edged to the side of the heavy wooden door, his hand close to his sword handle.
All the others except Mackintosh were by now asleep. Only the quartermaster had
noticed it. He quickly moved to the side of the door opposite Hawksworth and
casually drew his heavy, bone-handled knife.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Without warning the door swung outward.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Facing them was the same bearded man who had invited them
ashore. The square behind him was bright now with the glare of late morning,
and in the light Hawksworth realized he was wearing an immaculate white turban,
a long blue skirt over tightly fitting white breeches, and ornate leather
shoes, turned up at the toe in a curved point. This time, however, he no longer
bore welcome.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Where have you anchored your ships?&quot; The Turki was
accented and abrupt.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>News travels fast, Hawksworth thought, as he tried to shove
the haze from his mind. &quot;Where is the Shahbandar?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Your merchantmen were not in the bay this morning.
Where are they now?&quot; The man seemed to ignore Hawksworth's question.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I demand to see the Shahbandar. And I'll answer no
questions till I do.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You do not demand of the Shahbandar.&quot; The man's
black beard worked nervously, even when he paused. &quot;You and all your men
are to be brought to the customs house, together with your goods.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Where is he now?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;He is here.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Where?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The Indian turned and gestured quickly across the maidan, the
square, toward the large windowless stone building that sat on the water's edge
opposite the fortress. Hawksworth looked at the cluster of armed guards and
realized this must be the mint. This was the building, he now remembered Karim
telling him, where foreign money was &quot;exchanged.&quot; All foreign coins,
even Spanish rials of eight, were required to be melted down and reminted into
rupees before they could be used for purchase. Supposedly a protection against
counterfeit or base coin, this requirement produced months of delay. The
Shahbandar gave only one alternative to traders in a hurry: borrow ready-made
rupees at exorbitant interest.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;After he has authorized the beginning of today's work
at the mint, he will verify the seal on the door of the customs house&quot;—he
pointed to the squat building adjoining their lodge—&quot;and open it for
today. All goods must be taxed and receive his <i>chapp </i>or seal before they
can enter or leave India.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The men had begun to stir, and Hawksworth turned to
translate. The English assembled warily, and the air came alive with an almost
palpable apprehension as Hawksworth led them into the bustling square.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We must wait.&quot; The tall Indian suddenly paused
near the center of the maidan, just as a group of guards emerged from the mint.
Each wore a heavy sword, and they were escorting a large closed palanquin
carried on the shoulders of four bearers dressed only in white skirts folded
about their waist. The guards cleared a path through the crowd of merchants,
and made their way slowly to the door of the customs house. The crowd surged in
behind them, blocking the view, but moments later the tall doors of the customs
house were seen to swing open, and the crowd funneled in, behind the palanquin
and the guards. Then the Indian motioned for them to follow.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The interior of the customs house smelled of sweat, mingled
with spice and the dusty fragrance of indigo. As oil lamps were lighted and
attached to the side walls, the milling crowd grew visible. Through the
semi-dark porters were already bearing the English goods in from the <i>maidan</i>
and piling them in one of the allotted stalls.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The tall guide turned to Hawksworth. &quot;You and all your
men must now be searched, here in the counting room.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'll not allow it.&quot; Hawksworth motioned the
English back. &quot;I told you I demand to see the Shahbandar.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;He'll receive you when he will. He has not granted an
audience.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then we'll not be searched. Tell him that. Now.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The Indian paused for a moment, then reluctantly turned and
made his way toward a door at the rear of the large room. Elkington pressed
forward, his face strained.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Tell the bleedin' heathen we're English. We'll not be
treated like this rabble.&quot; He motioned around the room, a bedlam of Arab,
Persian, and Indian traders who eyed the English warily as they shouted for the
attention of customs inspectors and competed to bribe porters.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Just hold quiet. I think they know exactly who we are.
And they know about the ships.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As they waited, Hawksworth wondered what he should tell the
Shahbandar, and he again puzzled over the words of Karim. Think. What can you
tell him that he hasn't already heard? I'll wager he knows full well we were
attacked by Portugals in the bay. That we burned and sank two galleons. Will he
now hold us responsible for warfare in Indian waters? I'll even wager he knows
we were attacked on the river. And who saved us.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The large Indian was returning, striding through the center
aisle accompanied by four of the Shahbandar's guards. He motioned for
Hawksworth to follow, alone.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The door of the rear chamber was sheathed in bronze, with
heavy ornate hinges and an immense hasp. It seemed to swing open of itself as
they approached.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>And they were in the chamber of the Shahbandar.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As he entered, Hawksworth was momentarily blinded by the
blaze of oil lamps that lined the walls of the room. Unlike the simple plaster
walls and pillars of the outer receiving area, this inner chamber was
forbiddingly ornate, with gilded ceilings almost thirty feet high. The room was
already bustling with clerks straightening piles of account books and readying
themselves for the day's affairs.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The room fell silent and a way suddenly cleared through the
center, as the Hindu clerks fell back along the walls. They all wore tight,
neat headdresses and formal cotton top shirts, and Hawksworth felt a sudden
consciousness of his own clothes—muddy boots and powder-smeared jerkin and
breeches. For the first time since they arrived he found himself in a room with
no other Europeans. The isolation felt sudden and complete.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then he saw the Shahbandar.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>On a raised dais at the rear of the room, beneath a canopy of
gold-embroidered cloth, sat the chief port official of India. He rested stiffly
on a four-legged couch strewn with cushions, and he wore a turban of blue silk,
narrow- patterned trousers, and an embroidered tan robe that crossed to the
right over his plump belly and was secured with a row of what appeared to be
rubies. He seemed oblivious to Hawksworth as he cursed and drew on the end of a
tube being held to his mouth by an attending clerk. The clerk's other hand
worked a burning taper over the open top of a long-necked clay pot. The tube
being held to the Shahbandar's mouth was attached to a spout on the side.
Suddenly Hawksworth heard a gurgle from the pot and saw the Shahbandar inhale a
mouthful of dark smoke.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Tobacco is the only thing the <i>topiwallahs </i>ever
brought to India that she did not already have. Even then we still had to</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>devise the
hookah to smoke it properly.&quot; He inhaled appreciatively. &quot;It is
forbidden during this month of Ramadan, but no man was made to fast during
daylight and also forgo tobacco. The morning sun still rose in the east, and
thus it is written the gate of repentance remains open to God's servants.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The Shahbandar examined Hawksworth with curiosity. His face
recalled hard desert nomad blood, but now it was softened with ease, plump and
moustachioed. He wore gold earrings, and he was barefoot.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Favor me by coming closer. I must see this <i>feringhi </i>captain
who brings such turmoil to our waters.&quot; He turned and cursed the servant
as the hookah continued to gurgle inconclusively. Then a roll of smoke burst
through the tube and the Shahbandar's eyes mellowed as he drew it deeply into
his lungs. He held the smoke for a moment while he gazed quizzically at
Hawksworth, squinting as though the air between them were opaque.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;They tell me you are English. May I have the pleasure
to know your name?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm Brian Hawksworth, captain of the frigate <i>Discovery</i>.
May I also have the privilege of an introduction.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I will stand before Allah as Mirza Nuruddin.&quot; He
again drew deeply on the hookah. &quot;But here I am the Shahbandar.&quot; He
exhaled a cloud and examined Hawksworth. &quot;Your ship and another were in
our bay yesterday. I am told they weighed anchor at nightfall. Do English
vessels customarily sail without their captain?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;When they have reason to do so.&quot; Hawksworth fixed
him squarely, wondering if he was really almost blind or if he merely wanted to
appear so.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And what, Captain . . . Hawksworth, brings you and your
contentious warships to our port? It is not often our friends the Portuguese
permit their fellow Christians to visit us.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Our ships are traders of England's East India
Company.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Do not squander my time telling me what I already
know.&quot; The Shahbandar suddenly seemed to erupt. &quot;They have never
before come to India. Why are you here now?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth sensed suddenly that the Shahbandar had been
merely toying with him. That he knew full well why they had come and had
already decided what to do. He recalled the words of Karim, declaring the
Shahbandar had his own private system of spies.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We are here for the same reason we have visited the
islands. To trade the goods of Europe.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But we already do trade with Europeans. The Portuguese.
Who also protect our seas.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Have you found profit in it?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Enough. But it is not you</span><span style='font-size:
 10.0pt;color:windowtext'>r place</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'> to question me, Captain Hawksworth.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then you may wish to profit through English trade as
well.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And your merchants, I assume, also expect to profit
here.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That's the normal basis of trade.&quot; Hawksworth
shifted, easing his leg.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The Shahbandar glanced downward, but without removing his
lips from the tube of the hookah. &quot;I notice you have a wound, Captain
Hawksworth. Yours would seem a perilous profession.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It's sometimes even more perilous for our
enemies.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I presume you mean the Portuguese.&quot; The Shahbandar
cursed the servant anew and called for a new taper to fire the hookah.
&quot;But their perils are over. Yours have only begun. Surely you do not
expect they will allow you to trade here.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Trade here is a matter between England and India. It
does not involve the Portugals.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The Shahbandar smiled. &quot;But we have a trade agreement
with the Portuguese, a <i>firman</i> signed by His Majesty, the Moghul of
India, allowing them free access to our ports. We have no such agreement with
England.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then we were mistaken. We believed the port of Surat
belonged to India, not to the Portugals.&quot; Hawksworth felt his palms
moisten at the growing game of nerves. &quot;India, you would say, has no ports
of her own. No authority to trade with whom she will.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You come to our door with warfare and insolence,
Captain Hawksworth. Perhaps I would have been surprised if you had done
otherwise.&quot; The Shahbandar paused to draw thoughtfully on the smoking
mouthpiece. &quot;Why should I expect this? Although you would not ask, let me
assume you have. The reputation of English sea dogs is not unknown in the
Indies.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And I can easily guess who brought you these libelous
reports of England. Perhaps you should examine their motives.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We have received guidance in our judgment from those we
have trusted for many years.&quot; The Shahbandar waved aside the hookah and
fixed Hawksworth with a hard gaze.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth returned the unblinking stare for a moment while
an idea formed in his mind. &quot;I believe it once was written, 'There are
those who purchase error at the price of guidance, so their commerce does not
prosper. Neither are they guided.'&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>A sudden hush enveloped the room as the Shahbandar examined
Hawksworth with uncharacteristic surprise. For a moment his eyes seemed lost in
concentration, then they quickly regained their focus. &quot;The Holy
Quran—Surah II, if I have not lost the lessons of my youth.&quot; He stopped
and smiled in disbelief. &quot;It's impossible a <i>topiwallah</i> should know
the words of the Merciful Prophet, on whom be peace. You are a man of curious
parts, English captain.&quot; Again he paused. &quot;And you dissemble with all
the guile of a <i>mullah</i>.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I merely speak the truth.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then speak the truth to me now, Captain Hawksworth. Is
it not true the English are a notorious nation of pirates? That your merchants
live off the commerce of others, pillaging where they see fit. Should I not
inquire, therefore, whether you intrude into our waters for the same
purpose?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;England has warred in years past on her rightful
enemies. But our wars are over. The East India Company was founded for peaceful
trade. And the Company is here for no purpose but to trade peacefully with
merchants in Surat.&quot; Hawksworth dutifully pressed forward. &quot;Our two
merchantmen bring a rich store of English goods—woolens, ironwork, lead . .
.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;While you war with the Portuguese, in sight of our very
shores. Will you next make war on our own merchants? I'm told it is your
historic livelihood.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As he studied Hawksworth, the Shahbandar found himself
reflecting on the previous evening. The sun had set and the Ramadan meal was
already underway when Father Manoel Pinheiro, the second-ranked Portuguese
Jesuit in India, had appeared at his gates demanding an audience.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>For two tiresome hours he had endured the Jesuit's pained
excuses for Portugal's latest humiliation at sea. And his boasts that the
English would never survive a trip upriver. And for the first time Mirza
Nuruddin could remember, he had smelled fear.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Mirza Nuruddin had sensed no fear in the Portuguese eight
years before, when an English captain named Lancaster had attacked and pillaged
a Portuguese galleon in the seas off Java. Then the Viceroy of Goa brayed he
would know retribution, although nothing was ever done. And a mere five years
ago the Viceroy himself led a fleet of twelve warships to Malacca boasting to
burn the eleven Dutch merchantmen lading there. And the Dutch sank almost his
entire fleet. Now the pirates of Malabar daily harassed Indian shipping the
length of the western coast and the Portuguese patrols seemed powerless to
control them. In one short decade, he told himself, the Portuguese have shown
themselves unable to stop the growing Dutch spice trade in the islands, unable
to rid India's coasts of pirates, and now . . . now unable to keep other
Europeans from India's own doorstep.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He studied Hawksworth again and asked himself why the English
had come. And why the two small English vessels had challenged four armed
galleons, instead of turning and making for open sea? To trade a cargo of wool?
No cargo was worth the risk they had taken. There had to be another reason. And
that reason, or whatever lay behind it, terrified the Portuguese. For the first
time ever.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We defend ourselves when attacked. That's all.&quot;
Hawksworth found himself wanting to end the questions, to escape the smoky room
and the Shahbandar's intense gaze. &quot;That has no bearing on our request to
trade in this port.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I will take your request under advisement. In the
meantime you and your men will be searched and your goods taxed, in keeping
with our law.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You may search the men if you wish. But I am here as
representative of the king of England. And as his representative I will not
allow my personal chest to be searched, no more than His Majesty, King James of
England, would submit to such an indignity.&quot; Hawksworth decided to reach
for all the authority his ragged appearance would allow.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;All <i>feringhi</i>, except ambassadors, must be
searched. Do you claim that immunity?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I am an ambassador, and I will be traveling to Agra to
represent my king.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Permission for <i>feringhi </i>to travel in India must
come from the Moghul himself.&quot; The Shahbandar's face remained impassive
but his mind raced. The stakes of the English game were not wool, he suddenly
realized, but India. The English king was challenging Portugal for the trade of
India. Their audacity as astonishing. &quot;A request can be sent to Agra by
the governor of this province.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then I must see him to ask that a message be sent to
Agra. For now, I demand that my personal effects be released from the customs
house. And that no duty be levied on our goods, which are samples and not for
sale.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;If your goods are not taxed, they will remain in the
customs house. That is the law. Because you claim to represent your king, I
will forgo my obligation to search your person. All of your men, however, will
be searched down to their boots, and any goods or coin they bring through this
port will be taxed according to the prevailing rate. Two and one-half percent
of value.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Our Chief Merchant wishes to display his samples to
your traders.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I have told you I will consider your request for trade.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>There are
many considerations.&quot; He signaled for the hookah to be lighted again. The
interview seemed to be ended.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth bowed with what formality he could muster and
turned toward the counting-room door.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Captain Hawksworth. You will not be returning to your men.
I have made other arrangements for your lodging.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth revolved to see four porters waiting by an open
door at the Shahbandar's left.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I must be tired. I hadn't noticed the door until now.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then he realized it had been concealed in the decorations on
the wall. When he did not move, the porters surrounded him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>No, they're not porters. They're the guards who held back the
crowds from the steps. And they're armed now.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I think you will find your lodgings suitable.&quot; The
Shahbandar watched Hawksworth's body tense. &quot;My men will escort you. Your
chest will remain here under my care.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The Shahbandar returned again to his gurgling hookah.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;My chest will not be subject to search. If it is to be
searched, I will return now to my ship.&quot; Hawksworth still did not move.
&quot;Your officials will respect my king, and his honor.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It is in my care.&quot; The Shahbandar waved Hawksworth
toward the door. He did not look up from his pipe.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As Hawksworth passed into the midday sunshine, he saw the
Shahbandar's own palanquin waiting by the door. Directly ahead spread the
city's teeming horse and cattle bazaar, while on his right, under a dense
banyan tree, a dark-eyed beggar sat on a pallet, clothed only in a white
loincloth and wearing ashes in his braided hair and curious white and red marks
on his forehead. His eyes were burning and intense, and he inspected the new <i>feringhi
</i>as though he'd just seen the person of the devil.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Why should I travel hidden from view, Hawksworth puzzled?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But there was no time to ponder an answer. The cloth covering
was lifted and he found himself urged into the cramped conveyance, made even
more comfortless and hot by its heavy carpet lining and bolster seat. In
moments the street had disappeared into jolting darkness.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2><a name=bookmark7><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>CHAPTER SIX</span></a></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>        He
felt the palanquin drop roughly onto a hard surface, and when the curtains were
pulled aside he looked down to see the stone mosaic of a garden courtyard. They
had traveled uphill at least part of the time, with what seemed many
unnecessary turns and windings, and now they were hidden from the streets by
the high walls of a garden enclosure. Tall slender palms lined the inside of
the garden's white plaster wall, and denser trees shaded a central two-story
building, decorated around its entry with raised Arabic lettering in ornate
plasterwork. The guards motioned him through the large wooden portico of the
house, which he began to suspect might be the residence of a wealthy merchant.
After a long hallway, they entered a spacious room with clean white walls and a
thick center carpet over a floor of patterned marble inlay. Large pillows lay
strewn about the carpet, and the air hung heavy with the stale scent of spice.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It's the house of a rich merchant or official, all right.
What else can it be? The decorated panels on the doors and the large brass
knobs all indicate wealth. But what's the room for? For guests? No. It's too
empty. There's almost no furniture. No bed. No . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then suddenly he understood. A banquet room.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He realized he had never seen a more sumptuous private dining
hall, even among the aristocracy in London. The guards closed the heavy wooden
doors, but there was no sound of their footsteps retreating.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Who are they protecting me from?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>A servant, with skin the color of ebony and a white turban
that seemed to enclose a large part of his braided and folded-up beard, pushed
open an interior door to deposit a silver tray. More fried bread and a bowl of
curds.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Where am I? Whose house . . . ?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The man bowed, made hand signs pleading incomprehension, and
retreated without a word.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As Hawksworth started to reach for a piece of the bread, the
outer door opened, and one of the guards stepped briskly to the tray and
stopped his hand. He said nothing, merely signaled to wait. Moments later
another guard also entered, and with him was a woman. She was unveiled, with
dark skin and heavy gold bangles about her ankles. She stared at Hawksworth
with frightened eyes. Brisk words passed in an alien language, and then the
woman pointed to Hawksworth and raised her voice as she replied to the guard.
He said nothing, but simply lifted a long, sheathed knife from his waist and
pointed it toward the tray, his gesture signifying all. After a moment's pause,
the woman edged forward and gingerly sampled the curds with her fingers, first
sniffing and then reluctantly tasting. More words passed, after which the
guards bowed to Hawksworth almost imperceptibly and escorted the woman from the
room, closing the door.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth watched in dismay and then turned again to examine
the dishes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>If they're that worried, food can wait. Who was she? Probably
a slave. Of the Shahbandar?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He removed his boots, tossed them in the corner, and eased
himself onto the bolsters piled at one end of the central carpet. The wound in
his leg had become a dull ache.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Jesus help me, I'm tired. What does the Shahbandar really
want? Why was Karim so fearful of him? And what's the role of the governor in
all this? Will all these requests and permissions and permits end up delaying
us so long the Portugals will find our anchorage? And what will the governor
want out of me?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He tried to focus his mind on the governor, on a figure he
sculpted in his imagination. A fat, repugnant, pompous bureaucrat. But the
figure slowly began to transform, and in time it became the Turk who had imprisoned
him in Tunis, with a braided fez and a jeweled dagger at his waist. The fat
Turk was not listening, he was issuing a decree. You will stay. Only then will
I have what I want. What I must have. Next a veiled woman entered the room, and
her eyes were like Maggie's. She seized his hand and guided him toward the
women's apartments, past the frowning guards, who raised large scimitars in
interdiction until she waved them aside. Then she led him to the center of a
brilliantly lighted room, until they stood before a large stone pillar, a
pillar like the one in the porters' lodge except it was immense, taller than
his head. You belong to me now, her eyes seemed to say, and she began to bind
him to the pillar with silken cords. He struggled to free himself, but the
grasp on his wrists only became stronger. In panic he struck out and yelled
through the haze of incense.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Let . . . !&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm only trying to wake you, Captain.&quot; A voice cut
through the nightmare. &quot;His Eminence, the Shahbandar, has requested that I
attend your wound.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth startled awake and was reaching for his sword
before he saw the swarthy little man, incongruous in a white swath of a skirt
and a Portuguese doublet, nervously shaking his arm. The man pulled back in
momentary surprise, then dropped his cloth medicine bag on the floor and began
to carefully fold a large red umbrella. Hawksworth noted he wore no shoes on
his dusty feet.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Allow me to introduce myself.&quot; He bowed
ceremoniously. &quot;My name is Mukarjee. It is my honor to attend the celebrated
new <i>feringhi</i>.&quot; His Turki was halting and strongly accented.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>He knelt and deftly cut away the wrapping on
Hawksworth's leg. &quot;And who applied this?&quot; With transparent disdain he
began uncoiling the muddy bandage. &quot;The Christian <i>topiwallahs </i>constantly
astound me. Even though my daughter is married to one.&quot; One eyebrow
twitched nervously as he worked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth stared at him through a groggy haze, marveling at
the dexterity of his chestnut-brown hands. Then he glanced nervously at the
vials of colored liquid and jars of paste the man was methodically extracting
from his cloth bag.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It was our ship's physician. He swathed this after
attending a dozen men with like wounds or worse.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;No explanations are necessary. <i>Feringhi</i> methods
are always unmistakable. In Goa, where I lived for many years after leaving
Bengal, I once served in a hospital built by Christian priests.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You worked in a Jesuit hospital?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I did indeed.&quot; He began to scrape away the oily
powder residue from the wound. Hawksworth's leg jerked involuntarily from the
flash of pain. &quot;Please do not move. Yes, I served there until I could
abide it no more. It was a very exclusive hospital. Only <i>feringhi </i>were
allowed to go there to be bled.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He began to wash the wound, superficial but already festering,
with a solution from one of the vials. &quot;Yes, we Indians were denied that
almost certain entry into Christian paradise represented by its portals. But it
was usually the first stop for arriving Portuguese, after the brothels.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But why do so many Portuguese sicken after they reach
Goa?&quot; Hawksworth watched Mukarjee begin to knead a paste that smelled
strongly of sandalwood spice.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It's well that you ask, Captain Hawksworth.&quot;
Mukarjee tested the consistency of the sandalwood paste with his finger and
then placed it aside, apparently to thicken. &quot;You appear to be a strong
man, but after many months at sea you may not be as virile as you assume.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He absently extracted a large, dark green leaf from the
pocket of his doublet and dabbed it in a paste he kept in a crumpled paper.
Then he rolled it around the cracked pieces of a small brown nut, popped it
into his mouth, and began to chew. Suddenly remembering himself, he stopped and
produced another leaf from his pocket.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Would you care to try betel, what they call pan here in
Surat? It's very healthy for the teeth. And the digestion.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What is it?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;A delicious leaf. I find I cannot live without it, so
perhaps it's a true addiction. It's slightly bitter by itself, but if you roll
it around an areca nut and dip it in a bit of lime—which we make from mollusk
shells—it is perfectly exquisite.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth shook his head in wary dissent, whereupon Mukarjee
continued, settling himself on his haunches and sucking contentedly on the
rolled leaf as he spoke. &quot;You ask why I question your well-being, Captain?
Because a large number of the <i>feringhis</i> who come to Goa, and India, are
doomed to die.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;You already said that. From what? Poison in
their food?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Mukarjee examined him quizzically for a moment as he
concentrated on the rolled leaf, savoring the taste, and Hawksworth noticed a
red trickle emerge from the corner of his mouth and slide slowly off his chin.
He turned and discharged a mouthful of juice into a small brass container,
clearing his mouth to speak.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The most common illness for Europeans here is called
the bloody flux.&quot; Mukarjee tested the paste again with his finger, and
then began to stir it vigorously with a wooden spatula. &quot;For four or five
days the body burns with intense heat, and then either it is gone or you are
dead.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Are there no medicines?&quot; Hawksworth watched as he
began to spread the paste over the wound.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Of course there are medicines.&quot; Mukarjee chuckled
resignedly. &quot;But the Portuguese scorn to use them.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Probably wisely,&quot; Hawksworth reflected. &quot;It's
said the flux is caused by an excess of humors in the blood. Bleeding is the
only real remedy.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I see.&quot; Mukarjee began to apply the paste and then
to bind Hawksworth's leg with a swath of white cloth. &quot;Yes, my friend,
that is what the Portuguese do—you must hold still—and I have personally
observed how effective it is in terminating illness.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The damned Jesuits are the best physicians in
Europe.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;So I have often been told. Most frequently at
funerals.&quot; Mukarjee quickly tied a knot in the binding and spat another
mouthful of red juice. &quot;Your wound is really nothing more than a scratch.
But you would have been dead in a fortnight. By this, if not by exertion.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Hawksworth rose and tested his
leg, amazed that the pain seemed to have vanished.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The greatest scourge of all for newly arrived Europeans</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>here seems
to be our women. It is inevitable, and my greatest source of amusement.&quot;
He spat the exhausted betel leaf toward the corner of the room and paused
dramatically while he prepared another.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Explain what you mean about the women.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Let me give you an example from Goa.&quot; Mukarjee
squatted again. &quot;The Portuguese soldiers arriving from Lisbon each year
tumble from their ships more dead than alive, weak from months at sea and the
inevitable scurvy. They are in need of proper food, but they pay no attention
to this, for they are even more starved for the company of women. . . . By the
way, how is your wound?&quot; Mukarjee made no attempt to suppress a smile at
Hawksworth's astonished testing of his leg.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The pain seems to be gone.&quot; He tried squatted in
Indian style, like Mukarjee, and found that this posture, too, brought no
discomfort.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, these scurvy-weakened soldiers immediately avail
themselves of Goa's many well-staffed brothels—which, I note, Christians seem
to frequent with greater devotion than their fine churches. What uneven test of
skill and vigor transpires I would not speculate, but many of these <i>feringhis
</i>soon find the only beds suited for them are in the Jesuit's Kings Hospital,
where few ever leave. I watched some five hundred Portuguese a year tread this
path of folly.&quot; Mukarjee's lips were now the hue of the rose.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And what happens to those who do live?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;They eventually wed one of our women, or one of their
own, and embrace the life of sensuality that marks the Portuguese in Goa. With
twenty, sometimes even thirty slaves to supply their wants and pleasure. And
after a time they develop stones in the kidney, or gout, or some other
affliction of excess.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What do their wives die of? The same thing?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Some, yes, but I have also seen many charged with
adultery by their fat Portuguese husbands—a suspicion rarely without grounds,
for they really have nothing more to do on hot afternoons than chew betel and
intrigue with the lusty young soldiers—and executed. The women are said to deem
it an honorable martyrdom, vowing they die for love.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Mukarjee rose and began meticulously replacing the vials in
his cloth bag. &quot;I may be allowed to visit you again if you wish, but I
think there's no need. Only forgo the company of our women for a time, my
friend. Practice prudence before pleasure.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>A shaft of light from the hallway cut across the room, as the
door opened without warning. A guard stood in the passageway, wearing a uniform
Hawksworth had not seen before.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I must be leaving now.&quot; Mukarjee's voice rose to
public volume as he nervously scooped up his umbrella and his bag, without
pausing to secure the knot at its top. Then he bent toward Hawksworth with a
quick whisper. &quot;Captain, the Shahbandar has sent his Rajputs. You must
take care.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He deftly slipped past the guard in the doorway and was gone.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth examined the Rajputs warily. They wore leather
helmets secured with a colored headband, knee- length tunics over heavy
tight-fitting trousers, and a broad cloth belt. A large round leather shield
hung at each man's side, suspended from a shoulder strap, and each guard wore
an ornate quiver at his waist from which protruded a heavy horn bow and bamboo
arrows. All were intent and unsmiling. Their leader, his face framed in a
thicket of coarse black hair, stepped through the doorway and addressed
Hawksworth in halting Turki.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The Shahbandar has requested your presence at the
customs house. I am to inform you he has completed all formalities for admission
of your personal chest and has approved it with his <i>chapp</i>.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The palanquin was nowhere to be seen when they entered the
street, but now Hawksworth was surrounded. As they began walking he noticed the
pain in his leg was gone. The street was lined by plaster walls and the cool
evening air bore the scent of flowers from their concealed gardens. The houses
behind the walls were partially shielded by tall trees, but he could tell they
were several stories high, with flat roofs on which women clustered, watching.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>These must all be homes of rich Muslim merchants. Palaces for
the princes of commerce. And the streets are filled with dark-skinned,
slow-walking poor. Probably servants, or slaves, in no hurry to end the errand
that freed them from their drudgery inside.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then as they started downhill, toward the river, they began
to pass tile-roofed, plaster-walled homes he guessed were owned by Hindu
merchants, since they were without gardens or the high walls Muslims used to
hide their women. As they neared the river the air started to grow sultry, and
they began passing the clay-walled huts of shopkeepers and clerks, roofed in
palm leaves with latticework grills for windows. Finally they reached the
bazaar of Surat, its rows of palm trees deserted now, with silence where
earlier he had heard a tumult of hawkers and strident women's voices. Next to
the bazaar stood the stables, and Hawksworth noticed flocks of small boys,
naked save for a loincloth, scavenging to find any dung cakes that had been
overlooked by the women who collected fuel. The air was dense and smelled of
earth, and its taste overwhelmed his lingering memory of the wind off the sea.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The streets of Surat converged like the spokes of a wheel,
with the customs house and port as its hub. Just like every port town in the
world, Hawksworth smiled to himself: all roads lead to the sea.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Except here all roads lead to the customs house and the
Shahbandar.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then, as they approached the last turn in the road, just
outside the enclosure of the customs house, they were suddenly confronted by a
band of mounted horsemen, armed with long-barreled muskets. The horsemen
spanned the roadway and were probably twenty in all, well outnumbering the
Rajputs. The horsemen made no effort to move aside as Hawksworth and his guards
approached.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth noticed the Rajputs stiffen slightly and their
hands drop loosely to the horn bows protruding from their quivers, but they did
not break their pace.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>My God, they're not going to halt. There'll be bloodshed. And
we're sure to lose.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Without warning a hand threw Hawksworth sprawling against the
thick plaster side of a building, and a large, round</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>rhino-hide
buckler suddenly was covering his body, shielding him entirely from the
horsemen.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Next came a melee of shouts, and he peered out to see the
Rajputs encircling him, crouched in a firing pose, each bow aimed on a horseman
and taut with its first arrow. The musket-bearing horsemen fumbled with their
still uncocked weapons. In lightning moves of only seconds, the Rajputs had
seized the advantage.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Not only are their bows more accurate than muskets,
Hawksworth thought, they're also handier. They can loose half a dozen arrows
before a musket can be reprimed. But what was the signal? I saw nothing, heard
nothing. Yet they acted as one. I've never before seen such speed, such
discipline.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then more shouting. Hawksworth did not recognize the
language, but he guessed it might be Urdu, the mixture of imported Persian and
native Hindi Karim had said was used in the Moghul’s army as a compromise
between the language of its Persian-speaking officers and the Hindi-speaking
infantry. The Rajputs did not move as the horseman in the lead withdrew a
rolled paper from his waist and contemptuously tossed it onto the ground in
front of them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>While the others covered him with their bows, the leader of
the Rajputs advanced and retrieved the roll from the dust. Hawksworth watched
as he unscrolled it and examined in silence. At the bottom Hawksworth could
make out the red mark of a <i>chapp</i>, like the one he had seen on bundles in
the customs house. The paper was passed among the Rajputs, each studying it in
turn, particularly the seal. Then there were more shouts, and finally
resolution. The dark-bearded leader of Hawksworth's guard approached him and
bowed. Then he spoke in Turki, his voice betraying none of the emotion
Hawksworth had witnessed moments before.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;They are guards of the governor, Mukarrab Khan. They
have shown us orders by the Shahbandar, bearing his seal, instructing that you
be transferred to their care. You will go with them.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then he dropped his bow casually into his quiver and led the
other men off in the direction of the customs house, all still marching, as
though they knew no other pace.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Captain Hawksworth, please be tolerant of our Hindu
friends. They are single-minded soldiers of fortune, and a trifle old-fashioned
in their manners.&quot; The leader of the guard smiled and pointed to a
riderless saddled horse being held by one of the riders. &quot;We have a mount
for you. Will you kindly join us?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth looked at the horse, a spirited Arabian mare, and
then at the saddle, a heavy round tapestry embroidered in silver thread with
tassels front and back, held by a thick girth also of tapestry. The stirrups
were small triangles of iron held by a leather strap attached to a ring at the
top of the girth. A second tapestry band around the mare's neck secured the
saddle near the mane. The mane itself had been woven with decorations of beads
and small feathers. The horse's neck was held in a permanent arch by a leather
checkrein extending from the base of the bridle through the chest strap, and
secured to the lower girth. The mare pranced in anticipation, while her coat
sparkled in the waning sun. She was a thing of pure beauty.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Where are we going?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But of course. The governor, Mukarrab Khan, has staged
a small celebration this afternoon and would be honored if you could join him.
Today is the final day of Ramadan, our month-long Muslim fast. He's at the <i>chaugan</i>
field. But come, patience is not his most enduring quality.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth did not move.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Why did the Shahbandar change his order? We were going
to the customs house to fetch my chest.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The governor is a persuasive man. It was his pleasure
that you join him this afternoon. But please mount. He is waiting.&quot; The man
stroked his moustache with a manicured hand as he nodded toward the waiting
mount. &quot;His Excellency sent one of his finest horses. I think he has a
surprise for you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth swung himself into the saddle, and immediately his
mare tossed her head in anticipation. She was lanky and spirited, nothing like
the lumbering mount his father had once taught him to ride at the army's camp
outside London so many, many years ago.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Without another word the men wheeled their horses and started
off in a direction parallel to the river. Then the one who had spoken abruptly
halted the entire party.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Please forgive me, but did I introduce myself? I am the
secretary to His Excellency, Mukarrab Khan. We were cast from the civilized
comforts of Agra onto this dung heap port of Surat together. Perhaps it was our
stars.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth was only half-listening to the man. He turned and
looked back over his shoulder in time to see the Rajputs entering into the
compound of the customs house. The leader of the horsemen caught his glance and
smiled.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Let me apologize again for our friends of the Rajput
guard. You do understand they have no official standing. They serve whomever
they are paid to serve. If that thief, the Shahbandar, discharged them tomorrow
and then another hired them to kill him, they would do so without a word.
Rajputs are professional mercenaries, who do battle as coldly as the tiger
hunts game.&quot; He turned his horse onto a wide avenue that paralleled the
river. The sunlight was now filtered through the haze of evening smoke from
cooking fires that was enveloping the city.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Do Rajputs also serve the governor?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The man laughed broadly and smoothed the braided mane of his
horse as he twisted sideways in the saddle and repeated Hawksworth's question
for the other riders. A peal of amusement cut the quiet of the evening streets.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;My dear English captain, he might wish to hang them,
but he would never hire them. His Excellency has the pick of the Moghul
infantry and cavalry in this district, men of lineage and breeding. Why should
he need Hindus?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth monitored the riders carefully out of the corner
of his eye and thought he detected a trace of nervousness in their mirth. Yes,
he told himself, why use Hindus—except the Shahbandar's Hindu mercenaries got
the advantage of you in only seconds. While you and your pick of the Moghul
cavalry were fiddling with your uncocked muskets. Perhaps there's a good reason
the Shahbandar doesn't hire men of lineage and breeding.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth noticed they were paralleling a wall of the city,
a high brick barrier with iron pikes set along its capstone. Abruptly the wall
curved across the road they were traveling and they were facing a massive
wooden gate that spanned the width of the street. Suddenly guards appeared,
each in uniform and holding a pike. They hurriedly swung wide the gate as the
procession approached, then snapped crisply to attention along the roadside.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;This is the Abidjan Gate.&quot; The secretary nodded in
response to the salute of the guards. &quot;You can just see the field from here.&quot;
He pointed ahead, then urged his horse to a gallop. A cooling dampness was
invading the evening air, and now the sun had entirely disappeared into the
cloud of dense cooking smoke that boiled above the city, layering a dark mantle
over the landscape. Again Hawksworth felt his apprehension rising. What's the
purpose of bringing me to a field outside the city, with dark approaching? He
instinctively fingered the cool handle of his sword, but its feel did nothing
to ease his mind.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then he heard cheers from the field ahead, and saw a burning
ball fly across the evening sky. Ahead was a large green, and on it horsemen
raced back and forth, shouting and cursing in several languages, their horses
jostling recklessly. Other mounted horsemen watched from the side of the green
and bellowed encouragement.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As they approached the edge of the field, Hawksworth saw one
of the players capture the burning ball, guiding it along the green with a long
stick whose end appeared to be curved. He spurred his mottled gray mount toward
two tall posts stationed at one end of the green. Another player was hard in
chase, and his horse, a dark stallion, was closing rapidly toward the rolling
ball. As the first player swept upward with his stick, lofting the burning ball
toward the posts, the second player passed him and—in a maneuver that seemed
dazzling to Hawksworth—circled his own stick over his head and captured the
ball in midair, deflecting it toward the edge of the green where Hawksworth and
his guards waited. Cheers went up from some of the players and spectators, and
the horsemen all dashed for the edge of the green in chase of the ball, which
rolled in among Hawksworth's entourage and out of play. The horseman on the
dark stallion suddenly noticed Hawksworth and, with a shout to the other
players, whipped his steed toward the arriving group.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As he approached, Hawksworth studied his face carefully. He
was pudgy but still athletic, with a short, well-trimmed moustache and a
tightly wound turban secured with a large red stone that looked like a ruby. He
carried himself erect, with a confidence only full vigor could impart, yet his
face was incongruously debauched, almost ravaged, and his eyes deeply weary.
There was no hint of either triumph or pleasure in those eyes or in his languorous
mouth, although he had just executed a sensational block of an almost certain
score. He reined his wheezing mount only when directly in front of Hawksworth,
sending up a cloud of dust.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Are you the English captain?&quot; The voice was loud,
with an impatient tone indicating long years of authority.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I command the frigates of the East India Company.&quot;
Hawksworth tried to keep his gaze steady. What sort of man can this be, he
asked himself? Is this the one who can demand the Shahbandar's signature and
seal whenever he wishes?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then I welcome you, Captain.&quot; The dark stallion
reared suddenly for no apparent reason, in a display of exuberance. The man
expertly reined him in, never removing his gaze from Hawksworth, and continued
in an even voice. &quot;I've been most eager to meet the man who is suddenly so
interesting to our Portuguese friends. Although I have a personal rule never to
dabble in the affairs of Europeans, as a sportsman I must congratulate you on
your victory. A pity I missed the encounter.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I accept your congratulations on behalf of the East
India Company.&quot; Hawksworth watched him for some sign of his attitude
toward the Portuguese, but he could detect nothing but smooth diplomacy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Yes, the East India Company. I suppose this company of
yours wants something from India, and I can easily imagine it might be profit.
Perhaps I should tell you straightaway that such matters bore me not a
little.&quot; The man glanced impatiently back toward the field. &quot;But
come, it's growing darker as we talk. I'd hoped you might join us in our little
game. It's elementary. Should be child's play for a man who commands at
sea.&quot; He turned to one of the men standing by the side of the field.
&quot;Ahmed, prepare a stick for Captain ... by the way, I wasn't given your
name.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Hawksworth.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Yes. Prepare a stick for Captain Hawksworth. He'll be
joining us.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth stared at the man, trying to gauge his
impulsiveness.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You, I presume, are the governor.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Forgive me. I so rarely find introductions required.
Mukarrab Khan, your humble servant. Yes, it's my fate to be governor of Surat,
but only because there's no outpost less interesting. But come, we lose
precious time.&quot; He pivoted his pawing mount about and signaled for a new
ball to be ignited.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You'll find our game very simple, Captain Hawksworth.
The object is to take the ball between the posts you see there, what we call
the <i>hal</i>. There are two teams of five players, but we normally rotate
players every twenty minutes.&quot; His horse reared again in anticipation as
the new ball was brought onto the field. &quot;Years ago we played only during
the hours of day, but then our Moghul’s father, the great Akman, introduced the
burning ball, so he could play at night. It's <i>palas </i>wood, very light and
slow-burning.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth felt a nudge on his hand and looked down to see a
stick being passed upward by one of the attendants. The handle was sheathed in
silver, and the stick itself was over six feet long, with a flattened curve at
the bottom, like a distorted shepherd's crook. Hawksworth lifted it gingerly,
testing its weight, and was surprised by its lightness.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You will be playing on the team of Abul Hasan.&quot; He
nodded toward a middle-aged man with a youthful face and no moustache. &quot;He
is a <i>qazi</i> here in Surat, a judge who interprets and dispenses law, and when
he's not busy abusing the powers of his office, he presumes to challenge me at <i>chaugan</i>.&quot;
The official bowed slightly but did not smile. His dappled gray mare was
sniffing at the governor's stallion. &quot;He thinks he has me at a
disadvantage, since in Agra we played with only one goal, whereas here they use
two, but <i>chaugan </i>is a test of skill, not rules. He leads the white
turbans.&quot; Only then did Hawksworth notice that the governor's team all
wore red turbans.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The governor waved to his attendant. &quot;A clean turban
for the English captain.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'd prefer to play as I am.&quot; Hawksworth saw a
flash of disbelief in the governor's eyes. It was obvious he was never
contradicted. &quot;I never wear a hat, though it seems in India I'm still
called a <i>topiwallah</i>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Very well, Captain Hawksworth. The <i>topiwallah </i>wears
no turban.&quot; He seemed to smile as he turned to the other players and
signaled for play to start. &quot;Abul Hasan's team is composed of Surat
officials, Captain. You will notice, however, that I am teamed with some of our
merchants—Muslim, of course, not Hindus—something I must do to ensure
challenging opponents. The mere presence of merchants here today should give
you some idea how very tedious I find living in Surat. In Agra no merchant
would be allowed near a <i>chaugan </i>field. But here my officials enjoy
winning their money so much that I am forced to relent.&quot; And he laughed
warmly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The burning ball was slammed toward the middle of the field,
and the players spurred their horses after it in lunging pursuit. Hawksworth
gripped the <i>chaugan</i> stick in his right hand and the reins in the other
as his mount galloped after the others, obviously eager to begin. The red
turbans reached the ball first, with the governor in the lead. He caught the
ball on a bounce and, wielding his stick in a graceful arc, whipped it under
the neck of the dark stallion and directly toward the <i>hal</i>, while in the
same motion reining in his mount sharply to follow its trajectory.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But a white turban had anticipated his shot and was already
in position to intercept the ball. He cut directly in front of the governor's
path and with a practiced swipe bulleted the ball back toward the center of the
field, knocking a spray of sparks across the face of the governor's horse.
Mukarrab Khan's stallion seemed scarcely to notice as he reared, whirled, and
flew in chase.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The shot had passed over the heads of the three other white
turbans and bounced off the grass a few feet behind Hawksworth, still well to
the rear. Hawksworth reined his mount about and bore down on the ball,
beginning to feel some of the exhilaration of the play. He reached the ball on
its second bounce and with a rigid arc of his arm swung the <i>chaugan </i>stick.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The impact recoiled a dizzying shock through the wood and up
his right shoulder. He dimly heard the cheers of his teammates, seeming to
congratulate him on his stroke. But where's the ball? he wondered as he scanned
the darkened, empty expanse down the field. Then he realized he had only
deflected it, back toward the three white turbans in the center of the field.
The last white turban in the row snared the ball with his stick, deflecting it
again, but now in the direction of the reds.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Dust was boiling from the surface of the field, increasingly
obscuring the players and the play. The darkened arena had become a jostling
mob, friend scarcely distinguishable from foe, and all in pursuit of the only
certain object, the still-glowing ball. Hawksworth's eyes seared and his throat
choked as he raced after the others—always, it seemed, bringing up the rear, while
his mount took her head and rarely acknowledged his awkward attempts to
command. He clung to the iron ring of his saddle, content merely to stay
astride.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Give me a quarterdeck any day.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The red turbans again had command of the ball, and Hawksworth
watched as the governor now raced to the lead, urged on by his teammates. He
snared the ball effortlessly and with a powerful swing sent it arcing back
toward his own <i>hal</i>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The other red turbans rushed in pursuit, but a white turban
was already at the <i>hal</i>, waiting to deflect the play. He snared the ball
in the crook of his stick and flung it back toward the center. The reds seemed
to anticipate this, for they reined as one man and dashed back. But now a white
had control, and he guided the ball alone across the grassy expanse, while a
phalanx of other whites rode guard. Hawksworth was still lagging in front of
his own <i>hal</i> when suddenly he saw the ball lofting toward him, a flaming
mortar in the darkened sky.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It slammed to earth near his horse's flank, spewing sparks.
He cut his mare sharply to the left and galloped in pursuit. Above the shouts
he only dimly heard the reds thundering behind him, closing in as he reached
the ball and caught it in the curve of his stick.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Roll it, he told himself, keep it on the ground . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The reds were on him. In what seemed a swing for the ball,
Abul Hasan brought his stick in a wide arc, its hardened crook accurately
intersecting Hawksworth's directly in the middle. Hawksworth felt an uneven
shudder pulse through his arm and heard his own stick shatter. The lower half
flew to his right, and he watched in dismay as it sailed across the path of
Mukarrab Khan's mount, just as the governor cut inward to block Hawksworth. The
hard wood caught the dark stallion directly across its front shins, and the
horse stumbled awkwardly. Hawksworth stared at horse and rider dumbly for a
moment, as the stallion lost its stride, and he suddenly realized the
governor's horse would fall. And when it did, Mukarrab Khan would be thrown
directly below the horses thundering behind them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He cut his mount sharply to the right and deliberately
slammed into the governor's stallion. Mukarrab Khan's dazed eyes flashed
understanding and he stretched for the center ring of Hawksworth's saddle
during the fractional second their horses were in collision. At the same
instant, he disengaged himself from his own stirrups and pulled himself across
the neck of Hawksworth's mare.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Two alert reds pulled their mounts alongside Hawksworth and
grabbed the reins of his mare. The dark stallion collapsed in the dust behind
them with a pitiful neigh. Then it rose and limped painfully toward the edge of
the field, its left foreleg dangling shattered and useless. Mukarrab Khan
lowered himself to the ground with an elaborate oath.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>A cheer sounded as the whites scored the ball unmolested.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth was still watching the governor when one of the
attendants rushed from the sidelines, seized the silver-topped fragment of his
broken stick, and thrust it toward him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The silver is yours to keep, Sahib. It is the custom
that one whose <i>chaugan</i> stick is broken in play may keep its silver tip.
As a token of bravery. For you it is especially deserved.&quot; He was short,
swarthy, and dressed in a dust- covered white shirt. He bowed slightly, while
his eyes gleamed their admiration in the darkness.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Take it, Captain. It is an honor.&quot; Abul Hasan rode
up stiffly, brushing the dust from the mane of his horse. &quot;No <i>feringhi</i>,
to my knowledge, has ever before attempted <i>chaugan</i>, and certainly none
has earned a silver knob.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Captain Hawksworth, you rode well.&quot; Mukarrab Khan
had commandeered a mount and also drew alongside. There was a light scratch
along the right side of his face, and the whimsical look had vanished from his
eyes as he searched the faces clustered around. &quot;A very curious accident.
It has never happened before.&quot; He stared directly at Hawksworth. &quot;How
was your stick broken?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The <i>feringhi</i> made an unfortunate swing,
Excellency,&quot; Abul Hasan interjected. &quot;He played superbly, for a
beginner, but he has still to fully master the stroke.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Obviously. But he compensated by his luck—my luck— in
saving me from a fall. He rides well enough, no matter how uncertain his
stroke.&quot; The governor examined them both skeptically.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth watched the exchange in incredulous silence. The <i>qazi</i>
may be covering for his own accident. Or perhaps it wasn't an accident. And if
not, then he tried to kill the Mukarrab Khan in a way that would look like it
was my responsibility.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I still maintain it was most curious.&quot; Mukarrab Khan
turned to watch as the stable-keepers prepared to shoot his favorite horse.
&quot;But tell me now what you think of <i>chaugan</i>, Captain
Hawksworth?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It's exhilarating. And dangerous. A seaman might say
it's like taking the whipstaff all alone in a gale, without a safety
line.&quot; Hawksworth tried unsuccessfully to decipher Mukarrab Khan's
thoughts.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;A quaint analogy, but doubtless apt.&quot; He tried to
smile. &quot;You know, Captain, there are those who mistakenly regard <i>chaugan
</i>as merely a game, whereas it is actually much, much more. It's a crucible
of courage. It sharpens one's quickness of mind, tests one's powers of
decision. The great Akman believed the same, and for that reason he encouraged
it years ago among his officials. Of course it requires horsemanship, but in
the last count it's a flawless test of manhood. You did not entirely disappoint
me. I suspect you English could one day be worthy of our little game.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>A shot rang out, and the governor's face went pale for an
instant, his eyes glossed with sadness. Then he turned again to Hawksworth.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Deplorable waste. To think I bought him just last year
especially for <i>chaugan</i>. From a grasping Arab, a confirmed thief who
sensed I fancied that stallion and absolutely refused to bargain.&quot; The
voice was calmer now, the official facade returning. &quot;But enough. Perhaps
I could interest you in a drink?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He signaled toward the edge of the field, and a waiting groom
ran toward them, bearing a black clay pot with a long spout.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The sun has set. Ramadan is finished for this year. So I
will join you. Let me show you how we drink on horseback.&quot; He lifted the
pot above his head, tilted the spout toward him, and caught the stream
effortlessly in his mouth. Then he passed it to Hawksworth. &quot;It's called <i>sharbat</i>.
The <i>topiwallahs </i>all seem to like it and mispronounce it 'sherbet.'&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The water was sugar sweet and tangy with bits of lemon. God,
Hawksworth thought, would we had barrels of this for the voyage home. As he
drank, drenching his beard, he first noticed the icy stars, a splendor of cold fire
in an overhead canopy. The town's smoke had been banished by the freshening
wind, and a placid silence now mantled the field. The players were preparing to
leave, and the grooms were harnessing the remaining horses to lead them home.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Tonight we feast to mark the end of Ramadan, Captain,
our month of fasting during daylight hours. It's an evening celebrating the
return of sensual pleasure.&quot; Mukarrab Khan stared at Hawksworth for a
moment. &quot;By the looks of you, I'd suspect you're no Jesuit. I would be honored
if you could join me.&quot; He forced a blithe cheerfulness his weary eyes
belied.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As Hawksworth listened, he realized he very much wanted to
go. To lose himself for a time. And suddenly the words of Huyghen, and of Roger
Symmes, flashed through his mind. Of the India you would not want to leave. <i>Until
you would not be able to leave.</i></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>As they rode toward the town, Mukarrab Khan fell
silent. And Abul Hasan, too, seemed lost in his own thoughts. Hawksworth slowly
let his horse draw to the rear in order to count the governor's personal
retinue of guards. Thirty men, with quivers of arrows beside their saddle,
pikes at their right stirrup, and a matchlock musket. As they rode, the other
horsemen eyed Hawksworth warily, keeping to themselves and making no effort to
talk. Hawksworth thought he sensed an underlying hostility lurking through the
crowd, but whether it was between the merchants and officials, or toward him,
he could not discern.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then a presumptuous thought passed through his mind.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Could this entire scene have been staged by Mukarrab Khan to
somehow test me? But to what purpose? What could he want to find out?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Whatever it was, I think he just may have found it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then he leaned back in the saddle, pushed aside his
misgivings, and sampled the perfumed evening air.</span></p>

<h2><a name=bookmark8><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>CHAPTER SEVEN</span></a></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>       They
were deep within the center of Surat, nearing the river, when suddenly the
street opened onto a wide stone-paved plaza. The first thing Hawksworth saw
through the torchlight was a high iron fence, sentries posted with bucklers and
pikes along its perimeter, and an ornate iron gate. Then, as they neared, he
realized the fence was the outer perimeter of an immense pink sandstone
fortress, with high turrets and a wide, arched entryway. Finally he spotted the
water-filled moat that lay between the fence and the fortress walls. The moat
was spanned by a single wooden bridge, and Hawksworth noted that when the
bridge was drawn inward it neatly sealed the entry of the fortress.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As they approached the iron outer gate, the party of <i>chaugan
</i>players began to disperse; after formal and minimal farewells the merchants
and officials turned and disappeared into the night. Soon only Hawksworth and
Mukarrab Khan were left, together with the governor's private grooms and
guards. Hawksworth studied the departing players with curiosity. What sway does
Mukarrab Khan hold over them? Respect? Fear?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then the iron gate swung wide and their horses clattered
across the wooden drawbridge. Hawksworth looked about and began to understand
that the governor's palace guards were not merely ceremonial. Lining both sides
of the drawbridge were uniformed infantrymen armed with pikes. Then as they
passed under the stone archway leading into the fortress, Hawksworth turned to see
even more armed guards, poised just inside, pikes in formal salute. And farther
back he saw two armored animals, gigantic, many times larger than the biggest
horse, with massive ears and a snout several feet in length.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>That must be what a war elephant looks like. So they really
do exist. But why so many guards? It's virtually a private army.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then he felt a groom tug the reins of his horse and signal
for him to dismount. They were now inside the palace grounds. Ahead, through an
intricate formal garden, stood the residence of the governor of Surat. The
elaborate carvings of its pink sandstone decoration reflected hard red in the
torchlight.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Mukarrab Khan directed him through a marble entryway,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>ornately
rounded at the top like the turret of a mosque. They had entered some form of
reception hallway, and Hawksworth noticed that the marble floor was decorated
with a complex geometry of colored stone.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Above his head were galleries of white plasterwork supported
by delicate arches, and along the sides were ornate, curtained recesses.
Hanging oil lamps brilliantly illuminated the glistening walls, while rows of
servants dressed in matching white turbans lined the sides in welcome.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As they approached the end of the reception hallway,
Hawksworth studied the door ahead. It was massive, and thick enough to
withstand any war machine that could be brought into the hallway, and yet its
protective function was concealed from obvious notice by a decoration of
intricate carvings and a flawless polish. The servants slowly revolved it
outward on its heavy brass hinges and Mukarrab Khan led them into a vast open
courtyard surrounded by a veranda, with columns supporting balconies of marble
filigree. It seemed a vast reception hall set in the open air, an elegant plaza
whose roof was stars, and whose centerpiece was a canopied pavilion, under
which stood a raised couch of juniper wood lined with red satin—not unlike an
English four-poster bed, save the posts were delicately thin and polished to a
burnished ebony. Large bronze lanterns along the balconies furnished a
flickering vision of the complex interworking of paths, flower beds, and
fountains surrounding the central pavilion.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Waiting on the veranda, just inside the entryway, were six
tall figures, three on either side of the doorway. They were turbaned,
exquisitely robed, and wore conspicuous jewels that gleamed against their dark
skin. As they bowed to the governor, Hawksworth examined them for a brief
moment and then his recognition clicked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Eunuchs. They must be Mukarrab Khan's private guards, since
they can go anywhere, even the women's apartments.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Captain Hawksworth, perhaps you should meet my
household officials. They are Bengalis—slaves actually— whom I bought young and
trained years ago in Agra. One must, regrettably, employ eunuchs to maintain a
household such as this. One's palace women can never be trusted, and one's
intriguing wives least of all. I named them in the Arab fashion, after their
position in the palace, so I need not trouble to remember their names, merely
what they do. This is Nahir, who is in charge of my accounts.&quot; He gestured
toward a pudgy face now glaring out from beneath a deep blue headdress, a tall
conical turban tied in place with a wrap of white silk that circled his bloated
throat. The eunuch's open jacket was a heavy brocade and it heaved as he
breathed, betraying the sagging fat around his nipples.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The one next to him selects my wardrobe.&quot; The
second eunuch gazed at Hawksworth impassively, his puffed, indulgent lips red
with betel juice. &quot;That one selects the clothes for my spendthrift women,
and the one on his left is responsible for all their jewels. The one over there
takes care of the household linens and oversees the servants. And the one
behind him is in charge of the kitchen. You will be asked to endure his
handiwork tonight.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The eunuchs examined Hawksworth's ragged appearance with
transparent contempt, and they seemed to melt around him as he walked through
the doorway—two ahead, two behind, and one on either side. None spoke a greeting.
Hawksworth examined them carefully, wondering which was in charge of the
women's apartments. That's the most powerful position, he smiled to himself,
nothing else really counts.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>A servant came down the veranda bearing a tray and brought it
directly to the governor. Then he kneeled and offered it. It was of beaten
silver and on it were two large crystal goblets of a pastel green liquid.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Captain, would you care to refresh yourself with a
glass of <i>tundhi</i>. It's the traditional way we break the fast of Ramadan.&quot;
He directed the servant toward Hawksworth. &quot;It's prepared in the women's
apartments during the day, as an excuse for something to do.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Hawksworth touched the drink lightly with his
tongue. It was a mixture of sweet and tang quite unlike anything he had ever
known. Perhaps the closest was a brisk mug of spiced</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>ale, pungent
with clove and cinnamon. But this spiced drink was mysteriously subtle.
Puzzling, he turned to Mukarrab Khan.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What is this? It tastes like the air in a garden.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;This? I've never paid any notice, although the women
down it by the basinful after sunset.&quot; As he received his own goblet he
turned to one of the eunuchs. &quot;Nahir, how do the women prepare <i>tundhi</i>?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;With seeds, Khan Sahib. Seeds of melons,
cucumber, lettuce, and coriander are pounded, and then blended with rosewater,
pomegranate essence, and juice of the aloe flower. But the secret is to strain
it properly, and I find I must carefully oversee the work.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Doubtless.&quot; Mukarrab Khan's voice was curt.
&quot;I suspect you should attend the accounts more and the women's apartments
less.&quot; He turned to another eunuch.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Is my bath ready?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;As always, Khan Sahib.&quot; As the eunuch bowed he
examined Hawksworth's dust-covered face and hair discreetly. &quot;Will the
distinguished <i>feringhi </i>also require a bath?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;He was on the <i>chaugan </i>field this afternoon, just
as I was.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth groaned inwardly. What English host would have the
effrontery to suggest a guest needed a bath? For that matter, what Englishman
would even consider bathing more than twice a year? It's known well enough King
James never bathes, that he never even washes his hands, only brushes them with
a moist napkin at mealtime. Yet this Moor wants a full bath before a meal,
merely to remove a bit of dust.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I would be content to rinse my hands.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Mukarrab Khan examined him for a moment and then broke into a
wide smile. &quot;I always forget <i>feringhi </i>are positively afraid of
water.&quot; He spoke quickly to one of the eunuchs, who turned and barked
orders to the servants in a language Hawksworth did not understand.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The servants will provide whatever you require.&quot;
Mukarrab Khan bowed perfunctorily to Hawksworth and disappeared through one of
the arched doorways leading off the courtyard, followed by the eunuchs. Then
Hawksworth turned to see a dark-skinned man bearing a large silver basin down
the veranda. Behind him a second man carried a red velvet cushion, shaped like
a long cylinder, and placed it on a stool next to the canopied pavilion,
gesturing for Hawksworth to sit.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As Hawksworth seated himself and turned toward the basin the
servant held waiting, he caught the fresh aroma of a full bouquet, as though
the fragrances of some tropic Eden had been distilled into the water. He looked
down to see flower petals floating on its shimmering, oil-covered surface. How
curious, he thought. English countrywomen sometimes distill toilet water from
the flowers in their gardens, but never in such quantities'that it can be used
merely to wash hands. And while English toilet waters are cloying and sweet,
violets and gilliflowers, this aroma is light and delicate.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>War elephants and perfumed waters, in the same palace. It's
incredible.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He gingerly splashed his hands, and looked up to find a
steaming towel being proffered. He sponged away the remaining mud of the
playing field and watched as one by one the servants began to melt into the
darkened recesses of the marble galleries. The last was an old withered
gamekeeper, who wandered through the garden berating a sullen peacock toward
its roost. And then the courtyard fell austerely quiet.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Illuminated now only by lanterns and pale moonlight, it
became a fairyland almost outside of time. He smiled as he thought of where he
had been only the previous night—fending off an attack by Portuguese infantry.
And now, this.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>His thoughts began to drift randomly, to float in and among
the marble latticework of the veranda. And he thought once more of Roger Symmes
and his bizarre stories of India.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He was right. It's a heaven on earth. But with an undertow of
violence just beneath the serene, polished surface. All this beauty, and yet
it's guarded with war elephants and a moat. It's a world that's . . .
artificial. It's carved of marble and jewels, and then locked away. Now I'm
beginning to understand why he found it so enticing. And frightening. God, for
a brandy. Now.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Khan Sahib awaits you.&quot; Hawksworth looked up to
see the eunuch standing directly in front of him, freshly attired in a long
robe of patterned silk. As he rose, startled from his reveries, a pudgy hand
shot out and seized his arm.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Your sword is not permitted in the banquet room.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth froze. Then he remembered the knife strapped
inside the top of his boot and the thought gave him comfort.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He unbuckled his sword slowly, deliberately, pausing to meet
the eunuch's defiant stare as he passed it over.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The eunuch seemed to ignore Hawksworth's look as he
continued.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You will also remove your boots. It is against custom
to wear them in the banquet room.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth moved to protest, then sadly concluded there would
be no point. Of course the room would be filled with carpets. And that must be
the reason everyone I've seen here wears open shoes with the backs folded down:
they're constantly being removed at doorways.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He bent over and unbuckled his boots. The eunuch stiffened
momentarily when he saw the glint of the knife handle in the lamplight, but he
said nothing, merely swept up the boots with his other hand.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As they walked slowly down the marble hallway toward the
bronzed door of the banquet room, Hawksworth tried to rehearse what he would
say to Mukarrab Khan.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He has to petition the court in Agra to grant safe conduct
for the trip. He just has to send one letter. How can he possibly refuse?
Remember, you're an ambassador. . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The eunuch shoved wide the bronzed door, and Hawksworth was
astonished by what he saw.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The governor of Surat lounged against a purple velvet bolster
at the far end of a long room whose walls were a cool expanse of flawless white
and whose marble floor was softened with an enormous carpet in the thick Persian
style. His skin glistened with light oil, and he had donned a fresh turban,
patterned in brown and white, tied in intricate swirls, and bound with a strand
of dark jewels. A single large pearl hung over his forehead, and two tassels,
each also suspending a pearl, brushed his shoulders. He wore a tight-fitting
patterned shirt in pale brown, and over this a heavy green vest lined in white
satin and embroidered in gold. It was bound with a woven cinch decorated with
brocade. Around his neck were two strings of pearls, the shorter suspending a
large ruby from its center. He had put on heavy bracelets, and intricate rings
circled the first and fourth fingers of both hands. Hawksworth also noticed for
the first time that he wore earrings, each a tiny green emerald.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The eunuchs stood behind him, and around the sides of the
room servants and slaves stood waiting. Along a back wall two men sat silently
poised, one behind a pair of small drums and the other holding an ornate
stringed instrument, its polished body glistening in the light. The only women
in the room mingled among the servers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Captain Hawksworth, our fare tonight will be simple and
unworthy, but please honor my table by your indulgence.&quot; Mukarrab Khan
smiled warmly and motioned Hawksworth to enter. &quot;At least we can talk
freely.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Is this an official meeting?&quot; Hawksworth did not
move, but stood as officiously as he could muster.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;If you wish. Our meeting can be considered formal, even
if we are not.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then as ambassador of His Majesty, King James of England,
I must insist that you rise to receive me.&quot; Hawksworth tried to suppress
the feeling that he looked vaguely foolish as a barefoot ambassador. But no one
else in the room wore shoes either. &quot;A governor is still his king's
subject. I represent my king's person.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I was not informed you were an ambassador.&quot;
Mukarrab Khan's face sobered noticeably, but he did not move. &quot;You are
Captain-General of two merchant vessels.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm here in the name of the king of England, with
authority to speak for him in all matters regarding trade.&quot; Hawksworth
recalled the effect this had had on the Shahbandar. &quot;I'm entrusted with
his personal letter to the Moghul.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Mukarrab Khan examined Hawksworth for a long moment, seeming
to collect and assemble a number of thoughts.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Your request would be proper for an ambassador. Let us
say I comply in the interest of mutual good will.&quot; He rose and bowed
formally, if only sightly, more a nod. &quot;The governor of Surat welcomes
you, a representative of the English king.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And I convey my king's acknowledgement of your
welcome.&quot; Hawksworth entered and seated himself facing Mukarrab Khan,
against a large velvet bolster already positioned for him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And what is this letter your English king sends to His
Majesty?&quot; Mukarrab Khan reclined back on his own bolster and arched his
fingertips together.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That is a concern between King James and the
Moghul.&quot; Hawksworth caught the quickly suppressed flash of anger in
Mukarrab Khan's eyes. &quot;I only ask that you petition the court in Agra for
permission to travel there. It would also be helpful if you would order the
Shahbandar to allow our merchants to trade their goods at the port of
Surat.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Yes, I understand you had the pleasure of meeting our
Shahbandar. I regret deeply having to tell you I have virtually no influence
over that notorious man. He was appointed by the Moghul’s son, Prince Jadar,
who is in charge of administering this province. He acts very much as he
pleases.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Lie number one, Hawksworth thought: you forced him to order
my transfer here.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Surely you're aware,&quot; Mukarrab Khan continued
evenly, &quot;that no other Europeans besides the Portuguese have ever before
landed cargo on the shores of India. Arabs, Persians, even Turks are a common
sight, but no other Europeans. Not even your Dutch, who, I'm told, consort with
some of our southeastern neighbors. In fact, the Moghul’s trade agreement with
the Portuguese is intended to exclude all other Europeans.&quot; Mukarrab Khan
stirred on his bolster and signaled one of the eunuchs to prepare the carpet
for dining. &quot;Although frankly he has little choice, since they control the
seas. In fact, it might be said that they allow our merchants to trade. Indian
cargo vessels must all acquire a license from Portuguese officials in Goa
before leaving port.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The Portugals control India's trade because you've
allowed them to. Your territorial waters belong to India, or should.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Mukarrab Khan seemed to ignore Hawksworth as he watched the
servants spread a large covering of tooled leather across the carpet in front
of them. After a moment his concentration reappeared, and he turned abruptly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Ambassador Hawksworth, we do not need to be advised by
you how India should manage her own affairs. But perhaps I will advise you that
His Excellency, the Portuguese Viceroy, has already sent notice by messenger
that he intends to lodge charges of piracy against your two ships. He has
requested that they be confiscated and that you, your merchants, and your crews
be transferred to Goa for trial.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth's heart stopped and he examined Mukarrab Khan in
dismay. So the <i>chaugan </i>match had merely been an excuse to take him into
confinement. After a moment he stiffened and drew himself erect. &quot;And I
say the Portugals were the ones acting as pirates. Their attack on our English
merchantmen was in violation of the treaty of peace that now exists between
England and Spain, and by extension to the craven Portugals, who are now
nothing more than a vassal of the Spanish king.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Yes, I've heard rumors of this treaty. We in India are
not entirely ignorant of Europe. But His Excellency denies there's any such
treaty extending to our shores. As I recall he characterized England as an
island of stinking fishermen, who should remain content to fish their own
sea.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The treaty between England and Spain exists.&quot; Hawksworth
decided to ignore the insult. &quot;We have exchanged ambassadors and it is
honored by both our kings. It ended almost two decades of war.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I will grant you such a treaty may indeed exist.
Whether it applies here I do not know. Nor, frankly, do I particularly care.
What I do know, English ambassador, is that you are very far from the law
courts of Europe. The Portuguese still control the seas off India, as they have
done for a hundred years. And unenforceable treaties have little bearing on the
rule of might.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We showed you the 'might' of the Portugals
yesterday.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Mukarrab Khan laughed heartily, and when he glanced toward
his eunuchs, they returned obsequious grins. &quot;You are truly more naive
than I ever imagined, English Captain Hawksworth. What effect can one small
engagement have on the fleet of warships at Goa? If you want protection at sea,
you will have to provide it yourself. Is that what your king hopes to gain from
the Moghul, or from me?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I told you I have only two requests. One is your message
to Agra requesting permission for my journey. The other is your approval to
trade the cargo we've brought.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Yes, so you have said. Unfortunately, what you ask may
not be all that easy to grant. Your unhappy engagement with the Portuguese
Viceroy's fleet has made my situation more than a trifle awkward.&quot; He
leaned back and spoke rapidly in Persian to the eunuchs standing behind him.
Then he turned back to Hawksworth. &quot;But as one of our Agra poets, a Sufi
rascal named Samad, once penned, The thread of life is all too short; the soul
tastes wine and passes on.' Before we explore these tiresome concerns further,
let us taste some wine.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The eunuchs were already dictating orders to the servants. A
silver chalice of fresh fruit appeared beside Hawksworth, brimming with
mangoes, oranges larger than he had ever before seen, slices of melon, and
other unknown fruits of varied colors. A similar bowl was placed beside
Mukarrab Khan, who seemed to ignore it. Then as Hawksworth watched, the
servants began spreading a white linen cloth over the red leather coverlet that
had been placed on the carpet in front of them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;A host is expected, Ambassador, to apologize for the
meal he offers. I will take the occasion to do that now.&quot; Mukarrab Khan
flashed a sprightly smile. &quot;But perhaps after your months at sea, you will
be lenient. For my own part, I have fasted today, and there's an Arab proverb
that hunger is the best spice. Still, I prefer leisurely gratification. I
concur with our Hindu sensualists that pleasure prolonged is pleasure enhanced.
All pleasure. Perhaps this evening you will see their wisdom.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Before Hawksworth could respond, two heavy doors at the back
of the room slowly opened, glinting the lamplight off their elaborate filigree
of gold and bronze, and the first trays appeared, covered with silver lids and
borne by young men from the kitchen. Uniformed servants preceded them into the
room. One by one the trays were passed to the eunuchs, who removed their lids
and carefully inspected the contents of each dish. After a brief consultation,
the eunuchs ordered several of the dishes returned to the kitchen.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth suddenly realized he was ravenous, and he watched
the departing dishes in dismay. Did they somehow fail the eunuchs' exacting
standards? Sweet Jesus, who cares? It all looks delicious.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>After final approval by the eunuchs, the silver serving bowls
were passed to servants waiting along the sides of the room, who in turn
arrayed them across the linen cloth between Hawksworth and Mukarrab Khan. A
chief server then knelt behind the dishes, while several stacks of porcelain
plates were placed next to him. Hawksworth tried to count the silver serving
bowls, but stopped after twenty.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>One by one the server ceremoniously removed the silver lids
from the bowls. Beneath them the contents of the dishes had been arrayed in the
colors of a rainbow. On beds of rice that ranged from white to saffron to
green, and even purple, was an overwhelming array of meats, fish, and birds of
all sizes. There were carved baked fruits; tiny balls of meat flaked with spice
and coconut; fried vegetables surrounded by silver cups of a pastel green
sauce; large flat fish encased in dark baking shells flecked with red and green
spices; and a virtual aviary of wild fowl, from small game birds to plump pea
hens.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The server dished hearty helpings from each bowl onto
separate porcelain plates, together with mounds of almond rice and jellied
fruits. As he started to pass the first plate to Hawksworth, Mukarrab Khan
roughly arrested his hand. &quot;This ill-bred kitchen <i>wallah</i> will serve
in the stables after tonight.&quot; He seized the serving spoons and, with a
flourish of traditional Moghul etiquette, personally laded extra portions from
each of the dishes onto Hawksworth's plates. The server beamed a knowing smile.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth stared at the food for a moment, dazzled, and then
he gingerly sampled a meatball. The taste was delicious, yet hardy, and he
caught the musky flavor of lamb, lightened and transmuted by a bouquet of
spice. He next pulled away the side of a fish and wolfed it, before realizing
the red and green flecks on its surface were some incendiary garnish. He
surveyed the room in agony, praying for a mug of ale, till an alert eunuch
signaled a servant to pass a dish of yogurt. To his amazement, the tangy, ice
cold liquid seemed to instantly dissolve the fire on his tongue.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He plunged back into the dishes. He had never eaten like this
before, even in England. He suddenly recalled with a smile an episode six
months into the voyage. After Zanzibar, when he had become so weary of stale
salt pork and biscuit he thought he could not bear to see it again, he had
locked the door of the Great Cabin and composed a full English banquet in his
mind—roast capon, next a pigeon pie larded in bacon fat, then a dripping red
side of roast mutton, followed by oysters on the shell spiced with grilled eel,
and finally a thick goose pudding on honeyed ham. And to wash it down, a bottle
of sack to begin and a sweet muscadel, mulled even sweeter with sugar, to end.
But this! No luscious pork fat, and not nearly cloying enough for a true
Englishman. Yet it worked poetry. Symmes was right. This was heaven.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>With both hands he ripped the leg off a huge bird that had
been basted to a glistening red and, to the visible horror of the server,
dipped it directly into one of the silver bowls of saffron sauce meant for
pigeon eggs. Hawksworth looked up in time to catch the server's look.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Does he think I don't like the food?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>To demonstrate appreciation, he hoisted a goblet of wine to toast
the server, while he stretched for a piece of lamb with his other hand. But
instead of acknowledging the compliment, the server went pale.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It's customary, Ambassador, to use only one's right
hand when eating.&quot; Mukarrab Khan forced a polite smile. &quot;The left is
normally reserved for . . . attending to other functions.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth then noticed how Mukarrab Khan was dining. He,
too, ate with his fingers, just as you would in England, but somehow he managed
to lift his food gracefully with balls of rice, the sauce never soiling his
fingertips.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>A breeze lightly touched Hawksworth's cheek, and he turned to
see a servant standing behind him, banishing the occasional fly with a large
whisk fashioned from stiff horsehair attached to a long stick. Another servant
stood opposite, politely but unnecessarily cooling him with a large fan made of
red leather stretched over a frame.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;As I said, Ambassador, your requests present a number
of difficulties.&quot; Mukarrab Khan looked up and took a goblet of fruit
nectar from a waiting servant. &quot;You ask certain things from me, things not
entirely in my power to grant, while there are others who make entirely
different requests.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You mean the Portugals.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Yes, the Portuguese Viceroy, who maintains you have
acted illegally, in violation of his law and ours, and should be brought to
account.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And I accuse them of acting illegally. As I told you,
there's been a Spanish ambassador in London ever since the war ended, and when
we return I assure you the East India Company will . . .&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;This is India, Captain Hawksworth, not London. Please
understand I must consider Portuguese demands. But we are pragmatic. I urge you
to tell me a bit more about your king's intentions. Your king's letter. Surely
you must know what it contains.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Mukarrab Khan paused to dip a fried mango into a shimmering
orange sauce, asking himself what he should do. He had, of course, posted
pigeons to Agra at sunrise, but he suspected already what the reply would be.
He had received a full account of the battle, and the attack on the river,
before the early, pre-sun Ramadan meal. And it was only shortly afterward that
Father Manoel Pinheiro had appeared, frantic and bathed in sweat. Was it a sign
of Portuguese contempt, he often wondered, that they would assign such an incompetent
to India? Throughout their entire Society of Jesus, could there possibly be any
priest more ill-bred? The Jesuit had repeated facts already known throughout
the palace, and Mukarrab Khan had listened politely, masking his amusement. How
often did a smug Portuguese find himself explaining a naval disaster? Four
Portuguese warships, galleons with two gundecks, humiliated by two small
English frigates. How, Mukarrab Khan had wondered aloud, could this have
happened?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;There were reasons, Excellency. We have learned the
English captain fired langrel into our infantry, shredded metal, a most
flagrant violation of the unwritten ethics of warfare.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Are there really supposed to be ethics in warfare? Then
I suppose you should have sent only two of your warships against him. Instead
you sent four, and still he prevailed. Today he has no need for excuses. And
tell me again what happened when your infantry assaulted the English traders on
the river?&quot; Mukarrab Khan had monitored the Jesuit's eyes in secret glee, watching
him mentally writhe in humiliation. &quot;Am I to understand you could not even
capture a pinnace?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;No one knows, Excellency. The men sent apparently
disappeared without a trace. Perhaps the English had set a trap.&quot; Father
Pinheiro had swabbed his greasy brow with the sleeve of his cassock. His dark
eyes showed none of the haughty disdain he usually brought to their meetings.
&quot;I would ask you not to speak of it outside the palace. It was, after all,
a special mission.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You would prefer the court in Agra not know?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;There is no reason to trouble the Moghul,
Excellency.&quot; The Jesuit paused carefully. &quot;Or Her Majesty, the queen.
This really concerns the Viceroy alone.&quot; The Jesuit's Persian was
grammatically flawless, if heavily accented, and he awkwardly tried to leaven
it with the polite complexities he had been taught in Goa. &quot;Still less is
there any need for Prince Jadar to know.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;As you wish.&quot; Mukarrab Khan had nodded gravely,
knowing the news had already reached half of India, and most certainly Prince
Jadar. &quot;How, then, may I assist?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The English pirate and his merchants must be delayed
here at least four weeks. Until the fleet of galleons now unlading in Goa,
those of the spring voyage just arrived from Lisbon, can be outfitted to meet
him.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But surely he and his merchants will sail when they
choose. And sooner if we deny them trade. Do you suggest that I approve this
trade?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You must act as you see fit, Excellency. You know the
Viceroy has always been of service to Queen Janahara.&quot; Pinheiro had paused
slyly. &quot;Just as you have been.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The cynicism of Pinheiro's flaunting his knowledge had galled
Mukarrab Khan most of all. If this Jesuit knew, who else must know? That the
governor of Surat was bound inescapably to the queen. That on any matter
involving Portuguese trade he must always send a formal message to the Moghul
and a secret one to the queen, and then wait while she dictated the ruling
Arangbar would give. Did this Jesuit know also why Mukarrab Khan had been
exiled from Agra? To the wilderness of provincial Surat? That it was on orders
of the queen, to marry and take with him a woman becoming dangerous, the <i>zenana
</i>favorite of the Moghul, before the woman's influence outweighed that even
of Janahara. And now this female viper was in his palace forever, could not be
removed or divorced, because she was still a favorite of the Moghul’s.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;So you tell me I must make them rich before you can
destroy them. That seems to be Christian wisdom at its most incisive.&quot;
Mukarrab Khan had summoned a tray of rolled betel leaves, signifying that the
interview was ended. &quot;It is always a pleasure to see you, Father. You will
have my reply when Allah wills.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The Jesuit had departed as awkwardly as he had come, and it
was then that Mukarrab Khan decided to meet the Englishman for himself. While
there was still time. How long, he wondered, before the Shahbandar realized the
obvious? And the prince?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>In the banquet room the air was now dense with the aroma of
spice. Hawksworth realized he had so gorged he could scarcely breathe. And he
was having increasing difficulty deflecting Mukarrab Khan's probing questions.
The governor was skillfully angling for information he properly did not need,
and he did not seem a man given to aimless curiosity.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What do you mean when you ask about the 'intentions' of
England?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;If the Moghul should approve a trade agreement with
your East India Company, what volume of goods would you bring through our port
here in Surat?&quot; Mukarrab Khan smiled disarmingly. &quot;Is the Company's
fleet extensive?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That's a matter better addressed to the merchants of
the Company.&quot; Hawksworth monitored Mukarrab Khan's expression, searching
for a clue to his thoughts. &quot;Right now the Company merely wishes to trade
the goods in our two merchantmen. English wool for Indian cotton.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Yes, I am aware that was the first of your two
requests.&quot; Mukarrab Khan motioned away the silver trays.
&quot;Incidentally, I hope you are fond of lamb.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The bronzed doors opened again and a single large tray was
borne in by the dark-skinned, unsmiling servants. It supported a huge cooking
vessel, still steaming from the oven. The lid was decorated with lifelike
silver castings of various birds and animals. After two eunuchs examined it,
the servants delivered it to the center of the linen serving cloth.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Tonight to signify the end of Ramadan I instructed my
cooks to prepare my special biryani. I hope you will not be disappointed. My
kitchen here is scandalous by Agra standards, but I've succeeded in teaching
them a few things.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The lid was lifted from the pot and a bouquet of saffron
burst over the room. Inside, covering a flawless white crust, was a second
menagerie of birds and animals, wrought from silver the thinness of paper. The
server spooned impossible portions from the pot onto silver plates, one for
Hawksworth and one for Mukarrab Khan. The silver-foil menagerie was distributed
around the sides of each plate.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Actually I once bribed a cook in the Moghul’s own
kitchen to give me this recipe. You will taste nothing like it here in
Surat.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth watched as he assembled a ball of the
rice-and-meat melange with his fingers and reverently popped it into his mouth.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Please try it, Ambassador. I think you'll find it
remarkable. It requires the preparation of two sauces, and seems to occupy half
my incompetent kitchen staff.&quot; The governor smiled appreciatively.
Hawksworth watched dumbfounded as he next chewed up and swallowed one of the
silver-foil animals.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth tried to construct a ball of the mixture but
finally despaired and simply scooped up a handful. It was rich but light, and
seemed to hint of every spice in the Indies.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;There are times,&quot; Mukarrab Khan continued,
&quot;when I positively yearn for the so-called deprivation of Ramadan. When
the appetite is whetted day long, the nightly indulgence is all the more
gratifying.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth took another mouthful of the savory mixture. After
the many long months of salt meat and biscuit, he found his taste confused and
overwhelmed by its complexity. Its spices were all assertive, yet he could not
specifically identify a single one. They had been blended, it seemed, to
enhance one another, to create a pattern from many parts, much as the marble
inlays of the floor, in which there were many colors, yet the overall effect
was that of a single design, not its components.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I've never tasted anything quite like this, even in the
Levant. Could you prepare instructions for our ship's cook?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It would be my pleasure, Ambassador, but I doubt very
much a <i>feringhi</i> cook could reproduce this dish. It's far too complex.
First my kitchen prepares a masala, a blend of nuts and spices such as almonds,
turmeric, and ginger. The bits of lamb are cooked in this and in ghee, which we
make by boiling and clarifying butter. Next a second sauce is prepared, this a
lighter mixture—curds seasoned with mint, clove, and many other spices I'm sure
you know nothing of. This is blended with the lamb, and then layered in the pot
you see there together with rice cooked in milk and saffron. Finally it's
covered with a crust of wheat flour and baked in a special clay oven. Is this
really something a ship's cook could do?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth smiled resignedly and took another mouthful.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Whoever thought there could be so many uses for spice. We use
spice in England, to be sure—clove, cinnamon, pepper, even ginger and
cardamom—but they're intended mainly to disguise the taste of meat past its
prime. But here spices are essential ingredients.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Let us return to your requests, Captain Hawksworth. I'm
afraid neither of these is entirely within my power to bestow. In the matter of
trading privileges for your cargo, I'll see what can be done. Yours is an
unusual request, in the sense that no Europeans have ever come here to war with
the Portuguese, then asked to compete with them in trade.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It seems simple enough. We merely exchange our goods
for some of the cotton cloth I saw arriving at the customs house this morning.
The Shahbandar stated you have the power to authorize this trade.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Yes, I enjoy some modest influence. And I really don't
expect that Prince Jadar would object.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;He's the Moghul’s son?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Correct. He has full authority over this province, but
he's frequently on campaign and difficult to reach. His other duties include
responsibility for military conscription here, and maintaining order. These are
somewhat uneasy times, especially in the Deccan, southeast of here.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;When will we learn your decision, or his decision?
There are other markets for our goods.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You will learn his decision when it is decided.&quot;
Mukarrab Khan shoved aside his plate and a servant whisked it from the carpet.
&quot;Concerning your second request, that I petition Agra to authorize your
travel there, I will see what can be done. But it will require time.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I would ask the request be sent immediately.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Naturally.&quot; Mukarrab Khan watched absently as more
brimming trays were brought in, these piled with candied</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>fruits and
sweetmeats. A hookah water pipe appeared and was placed beside Hawksworth.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Do you enjoy the new <i>feringhi </i>custom of smoking
tobacco, Captain Hawksworth? It was introduced recently, and already it's
become fashionable. So much so the Moghul just issued a decree denouncing
it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;King James has denounced it too, claiming it destroys
health. But it's also the fashion in London. Personally, I think it ruins the
taste of brandy, and wine.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Overall I'm inclined to agree. But tell me now, what's
your opinion of the wine you're drinking? It's Persian.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Better than the French. Though frankly it could be
sweeter.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Mukarrab Khan laughed. &quot;A common complaint from <i>topiwallahs</i>.
Some actually add sugar to our wine. Abominable.&quot; He paused. &quot;So I
gather then you only use spirits?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What do you mean?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;There are many subtle pleasures in the world,
Ambassador. Liquors admittedly enhance one's dining, but they do little for
one's appreciation of art.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As Hawksworth watched him, puzzling, he turned and spoke
quietly to one of the eunuchs hovering behind him. Moments later a small golden
cabinet, encrusted with jewels, was placed between them. Mukarrab Khan opened a
tiny drawer on the side of the box and extraced a small brown ball.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;May I suggest a ball of <i>ghola</i>? He offered it to
Hawksworth. It carried a strange, alien fragrance.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What's <i>ghola</i>?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;A preparation of opium and spice, Ambassador. I think
it might help you better experience this evening's entertainment.&quot; He
nodded lightly in the direction of the rear wall.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The snap of a drum exploded behind Hawksworth, and he whirled
to see the two musicians begin tuning to perform. The drummer sat before two
foot-high drums, each nestled in a circular roll of fabric. Next to him was a
wizened old man in a black Muslim skullcap tuning a large six-stringed
instrument made of two hollowed-out gourds, both lacquered and polished,
connected by a long teakwood fingerboard. About a dozen curved brass frets were
tied to the fingerboard with silk cords, and as Hawksworth watched, the player
began shifting the location of two frets, sliding them an inch or so along the
neck to create a new musical scale. Then he began adjusting the tension on a
row of fine wires that lay directly against the teakwood fingerboard,
sympathetic strings that passed beneath those to be plucked. These he seemed to
be tuning to match the notes in the new scale he had created by moving the
frets.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>When the sitarist had completed his tuning, he settled back
and the room fell totally silent. He paused a moment, as though in meditation,
then struck the first note of a somber melody Hawksworth at first found almost
totally rootless. Using a wire plectrum attached to his right forefinger, he seemed
to be waving sounds from the air above the fingerboard. A note would shimmer
into existence from some undefined starting point, then glide through the scale
via a subtle arabesque as he stretched the playing string diagonally against a
fret, manipulating its tension. Finally the sound would dissolve meltingly into
its own silence. Each note of the alien melody, if melody it could be called,
was first lovingly explored for its own character, approached from both above
and below as though a glistening prize on display. Only after the note was
suitably embroidered was it allowed to enter the melody—as though the song were
a necklace that had to be strung one pearl at a time, and only after each pearl
had been carefully polished. The tension of some vague melodic quest began to
grow, with no hint of a resolution. In the emotional intensity of his haunting
search, the passage of time had suddenly ceased to exist.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Finally, as though satisifed with his chosen scale, he
returned to the very first note he had started from and actually began a song,
deftly tying together the musical strands he had so painstakingly evolved. The
sought-for resolution had never come, only the sense that the first note was
the one he had been looking for the entire time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>This must be the mystical music Symmes spoke of, Hawksworth
thought, and he was right. It's unlike anything I've ever heard. Where's the
harmony, the chords of thirds and fifths? Whatever's going on, I don't think
opium is going to help me understand it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth turned, still puzzling, back to Mukarrab Khan and
waved away the brown ball—which the governor immediately washed down himself
with fruit nectar.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Is our music a bit difficult for you to grasp,
Ambassador?&quot; Mukarrab Khan leaned back on his bolster with an easy smile.
&quot;Pity, for there's truly little else in this backwater port worth the
bother. The cuisine is abominable, the classical dancers despicable. In
desperation I've even had to train my own musicians, although I did manage to
steal one Ustad, a grand master, away from Agra.&quot; He impulsively reached
for the water pipe and absorbed a deep draw, his eyes misting.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I confess I do find it hard to follow.&quot; Hawksworth
took a draft of wine from the fresh cup that had been placed beside him on the
carpet.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It demands a connoisseur's taste, Ambassador, not
unlike an appreciation of fine wine.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The room grew ominously still for a moment, and then the
drums suddenly exploded in a torrent of rhythm, wild and exciting yet
unmistakably disciplined by some rigorous underlying structure. The rhythm
soared in a cycle, returning again and again, after each elaborate interlocking
of time and its divisions, back to a forceful crescendo.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth watched Mukarrab Khan in fascination as he leaned
back and closed his eyes in wistful anticipation. And at that moment the
instrumentalist began a lightning-fast ascent of the scale, quavering each note
in erotic suggestiveness for the fraction of a second it was fingered. The
governor seemed absorbed in some intuitive communication with the sound, a
reaction to music Hawksworth had never before witnessed. His entire body would
perceptibly tense as the drummer began a cycle, then it would pulse and relax
the instant the cycle thudded to a resolution. Hawksworth was struck by the
sensuality inherent in the music, the almost sexual sense of tension and
release.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then he noticed two eunuchs leading a young boy into the
room. The youth appeared to be hovering at the age of puberty, with still no
trace of a beard. He wore a small but elaborately tied pastel turban, pearl
earrings, and a large sapphire on a chain around his pale throat. His elaborate
ensemble included a transparent blouse through which his delicate skin
glistened in the lamplight, a long quilted sash at his waist, and tight-fitting
trousers beneath light gauze pajamas that clung to his thighs as he moved. His
lips were lightly red, and his perfume a mixture of flowers and musk. The boy
reached for a ball of spiced opium and settled back against a quilted gold
bolster next to Mukarrab Khan. The governor studied him momentarily and then
returned to the music. And his thoughts.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He reflected again on Abul Hasan's blundering
&quot;accident&quot; on the <i>chaugan</i> field, and what it must signify. If
it were true the <i>qazi</i> had been bought by the Shahbandar, as some
whispered, then it meant Mirza Nuruddin must be alarmed to the point of
imprudence. Fearful of what could happen if the English were detained long
enough for the Portuguese warships to prepare. Which meant that somewhere
behind it all lay the hand of Prince Jadar.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He examined Hawksworth again, wondering how this English
captain could have savaged the Viceroy's fleet with such embarrassing ease.
What, he asked himself again, will the queen order done?</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;I'm sorry you don't find our music more congenial.
Ambassador. Perhaps I too would be wiser if I loved it less. The passion for
classical music has cost many a great warrior his kingdom in India over the
last centuries. For example, when the great Moghul patriarch Akman conquered
Baz Bahadur, once the proud ruler of Malwa, it was because that prince was a
better patron of music than of the arts of war.&quot; He smiled reflectively.
&quot;Admittedly, the great Akman himself also flooded his court with
musicians, but then he had the wit to study arms as well. Regrettably, I find
myself lacking his strength of character.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He paused to take a sip of nectar, then shrugged. &quot;But
enough. Tell me now what you really think of my Ustad, my master sitarist.
There are those in Agra who will never forgive me for stealing him away.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm not sure what I think. I've never heard a
composition quite like the one he's playing.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What do you mean by 'composition'?&quot; Mukarrab
Khan's tone was puzzled.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That's how a piece of music is written out.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Mukarrab Khan paused and examined him skeptically for a long
moment. &quot;Written out? You write down your music? But whatever for? Does
that mean your musicians play the same song again and again, precisely the same
way?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;If they're good they do. A composer writes a piece of
music and musicians try to play it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;How utterly tiresome.&quot; Mukarrab Khan sighed and
leaned back on his bolster. &quot;Music is a living art, Ambassador. It's meant
to illuminate the emotions of the one who gives it life. How can written music
have any feeling? My Ustad would never play a raga the same way twice. Indeed,
I doubt he would be physically capable of such a boorish feat.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You mean he creates a new composition each time he
plays?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Not precisely. But his handling of the specific notes
of a raga must speak to his mood, mv mood. These vary, why not his art?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But what is a raga then, if not a song?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That's always difficult to explain. At some rudimentary
level you might say it's simply a melody form, a fixed series of notes around
which a musician improvises. But although a raga has a rigorously prescribed
ascending and descending note sequence and specific melodic motifs, it also has
its own mood, 'flavor.' What we call its <i>rasa</i>. How could one possibly
write down a mood?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I guess I see your point. But it's still confusing.&quot;
Hawksworth took another sip of wine. &quot;How many ragas are there?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;There are seventy-two primary scales on which ragas are
based. But some scales have more than one raga. There are ragas for morning,
for evening, for late at night. My Ustad is playing a late evening raga now.
Although he uses only the notes and motifs peculiar to this raga, what he does
with them is entirely governed by his feeling tonight.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But why is there no harmony?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I don't understand what you mean by 'harmony.'&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Striking several notes together, so they blend to
produce a chord.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Mukarrab Khan studied him, uncomprehending, and Hawksworth
continued.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;If I had my lute I'd show you how harmony and chords
are used in an English song.&quot; Hawksworth thought again of his instrument, and
of the difficulty he'd had protecting it during the voyage. He knew all along
it was foolish to bring it, but he often told himself every man had the right
to one folly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then by all means.&quot; The governor's curiosity
seemed to arouse him instantly from the opium. &quot;Would you believe I've
never met a <i>feringhi</i> who could play an instrument, any instrument?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But my lute was detained, along with all my belongings,
at the customs house. I was going to retrieve my chest from the Shahbandar when
you intercepted his men.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Ambassador, please believe I had good reason. But I
thought I told you arrangements have been made.&quot; He turned and dictated
rapidly to one of the eunuchs. There was an expressionless bow, and the man
left the room. Moments later he returned through the bronze entry doors,
followed by two dark-skinned servants carrying Hawksworth's chest, one at each
end.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I ordered your belongings sent from the customs house
this afternoon. You would honor me by staying here as my guest.&quot; Mukarrab
Khan smiled warmly. &quot;And now I would hear you play this English
instrument.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth was momentarily startled, wondering why his safety
was suddenly of such great interest to Mukarrab Khan. But he pushed aside the
question and turned to examine the large brass lock on his chest. Although it
had been newly polished to a high sheen, as had the entire chest, there was no
visible evidence it had been opened. He extracted the key from his doublet,
slipped it into the lock, and turned it twice. It revolved smoothly, opening with
a soft click.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The lute rested precisely where he had left it. Its body was
shaped like a huge pear cut in half lengthwise, with the back a glistening
melon of curved cedar staves and the face a polished cherry. The neck was
broad, and the head, where the strings were wound to their pegs, angled sharply
back. He admired it for a moment, already eager for the touch of its dark
frets. During the voyage it had been wrapped in heavy cloth, sealed in
oilskins, and stored deep in his cabin chest. Not till landfall at Zanzibar had
he dared expose it to the sea air.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Of all English music, he still loved the galliards of Dowland
best. He was only a boy when Dowland's first book of galliards was published,
but he had been made to learn them all by heart, because his exacting tutor had
despised popular ballads and street songs.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Mukarrab Khan called for the instrument and slowly turned it
in the lamplight, its polished cedar shining like a great jewel. He then passed
it to his two musicians, and a brief discussion in Persian ensued, as brows
were wrinkled and grave points adjudicated. After its appearance was agreed
upon, the instrumentalist gingerly plucked a gut string with the wire plectrum
attached to his forefinger and studied its sound with a distant expression. The
torrent of Persian began anew, as each string was plucked in turn and its
particular quality debated. Then the governor revolved to Hawksworth.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I congratulate your wisdom, Ambassador, in not
hazarding a truly fine instrument on a sea voyage. It would have been a waste
of real workmanship.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth stared at him dumbfounded.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;There's not a finer lute in London.&quot; He seized it
back. &quot;I had it specially crafted several years ago by a master, a man
once lute-maker to the queen. It's one of the last he made.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You must pardon me then, but why no embellishment? No
ivory inlay, no carved decoration? Compare, if you will, Ustad Qasim's sitar.
It's a work of fine art. A full year was spent on its decoration. Note the head
has been carved as the body of a swan, the neck and pegs inlaid with finest
ivory, the face decorated with mother-of-pearl and <i>lapis lazuli</i>. Your
lute has absolutely no decoration whatsoever.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The beauty of an instrument is in its tone.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Yes, that's a separate point. But perhaps we should hear
it played by one skilled in its use. I must confess we are all curious what can
be done with so simple an instrument.&quot; Mukarrab Khan shifted on his
bolster, while the young man next to him toyed with a jewel, not troubling to
disguise his boredom.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth tuned the strings quickly and meticulously. Then
he settled himself on the carpet and took a deep breath. His fingers were
stiff, his mind groggy with wine, but he would play a song he knew well. A
galliard Dowland had written when Queen Elizabeth was still alive, in honor of
a Cornwall sea captain named Piper, whom she'd given a letter of marque to
attack the Spanish, but who instead turned an uncontrollable pirate, pillaging
the shipping of any flag convenient. He'd become an official outlaw but a genuine
English folk hero, and Dowland had honored his memory with a rousing
composition—&quot;Piper's Galliard.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>A full chord, followed by a run of crisp notes, cut the close
air. The theme was somber, a plaintive query in a minor mode followed by a
melodic but defiant reply. Just the answer Piper would have given to the
charges, Hawksworth thought.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The servants had all gathered to listen, and the eunuchs had
stopped gossiping. Then Hawksworth glanced toward the musicians, who had
shifted themselves onto the carpet to watch. Both the sitarist and his drummer
still eyed the instrument skeptically, no hint of appreciation in their look.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth had expected it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Wait till they hear this.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He crouched over the lute and attacked the strings with all
four fingers, producing a dense toccata, with three melodic lines advancing at
once, two in the treble and one in the base. His hand flew over the frets until
it seemed every fingertip commanded a string, each embellishing a theme another
had begun. Then he brought the galliard to a rousing crescendo with a flourish
that spanned two entire octaves.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>A polite silence seemed to grip the room. Mukarrab Khan
sipped thoughtfully from his cup for a moment, his jeweled rings refracting the
lamplight, then summoned a eunuch and whispered briefly in his ear. As the
eunuch passed the order to a hovering servant, Mukarrab Khan turned to
Hawksworth.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Your English music is interesting, Ambassador, if
somewhat simple.&quot; He cleared his throat as an excuse to pause. &quot;But
frankly I must tell you it touched only my mind. Not my heart. Although I heard
it, I did not feel it. Do you understand the difference? I sensed nothing of
its rasa, the emotion and desire one should taste at a moment like this, the
merging of sound and spirit. Your English music seems to stand aloof,
unapproachable.&quot; Mukarrab Khan searched for words. &quot;It inhabits its
own world admirably, but it did not enter mine.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Servants suddenly appeared bearing two silver trays, on which
were crystal cups of green, frothy liquid. As the servant placed Hawksworth's
tray on the patterned carpet, he bowed, beaming. Mukarrab Khan ignored his own
tray and instead summoned the sitarist, Bahram Qasim, to whisper brief
instructions in his ear. Then the governor turned to Hawksworth.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Perhaps I can show you what I mean. This may be
difficult for you, so first I would urge you try a cup of <i>bhang</i>. It has
the remarkable effect of opening one's heart.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth tested the beverage warily. Its underlying
bitterness had been obscured with sweet yogurt and potent spices. It was
actually very palatable. He drank again, this time thirstily.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What did you call this? <i>Bhang?”</i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Yes, it's made from the leaves of hemp. Unlike wine,
which only dulls the spirit, <i>bhang </i>hones the senses. Now I've arranged a
demonstration for you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He signaled the sitarist, and Bahram Qasim began the
unmistakable theme of &quot;Piper's Galliard.&quot; The song was drawn out
slowly, languorously, as each individual note was introduced, lovingly explored
for its own pure sound, and then framed with microtone embellishment and a
sensual vibrato. The clear, simple notes of the lute were transmuted into an
almost orchestral richness by an undertone of harmonic density from the sitar's
sympathetic strings, the second row of wires beneath those being plucked, tuned
to match the notes of the song and respond without being touched. Dowland's
harmonies were absent, but now the entire room resonated with a single majestic
chord underlying each note. Gradually the sitarist accelerated the tempo, while
also beginning to insert his own melodic variations over the original notes of
the theme.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth took another sip of <i>bhang </i>and suddenly
noticed the notes seemed to be weaving a tapestry in his mind, evolving an
elaborate pattern that enveloped the room with shapes as colored as the
geometries of the Persian carpet.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Next the drummer casually introduced a rhythmic underpinning,
his lithe fingers touring easily over and around the taut drumheads as he
dissected, then restructured the simple meter of Dowland's music. He seemed to
regard the original meter as merely a frame, a skeleton on which the real
artistry had yet to be applied. He knowingly subdivided Dowland's meter into
minuscule elements of time, and with these devised elaborate new interlockings
of sound and silence. Yet each new structure always <i>Resolve</i>d to its
perfect culmination at the close of a musical phrase. Then as he punctuated his
transient edifice with a thud of the larger drum—much as an artist might sign a
painting with an elaborate flourish—he would catch Hawksworth's incredulous
gaze and wink, his eyes twinkling in triumph.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Meanwhile, the sitarist structured Dowland's spirited theme
to the drummer's frame, adding microtones Dowland had never imagined, and
matching the ornate tempo of the drum as they blended together to become a
single racing heartbeat.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth realized suddenly that he was no longer merely
hearing the music, that instead he seemed to be absorbing it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>How curious . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The music soared on to a final crescendo, a simultaneous</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>climax of
sitar and drum, and then the English song seemed to dissolve slowly into the
incense around them. After only a moment's pause, the musicians immediately
took up a sensuous late evening raga.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth looked about and noticed for the first time that
the lamps in the room had been lowered, settling a semi- darkness about the
musicians and the moving figures around him. He felt for his glass of <i>bhang</i>
and saw that it was dry, and that another had been placed beside it. He drank
again to clear his mind.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>What's going on? Damned if I'll stay here. My God, it's
impossible to think. I'm tired. No, not tired. It's just . . . just that my
mind is . . . like I'd swilled a cask of ale. But I'm still in perfect control.
And where's Mukarrab Khan? Now there are screens where he was sitting. Covered
with peacocks that strut obscenely from one screen to the other. And the
eunuchs are all watching. Bastards. I'll take back my sword. Jesus, where is
it? I've never felt so adrift. But I'm not staying. I'll take the chest and
damn his eunuchs. And his guards. He can't hold me here. Not even on charges.
There are no charges. I'm leaving. I'll find the men . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He pulled himself defiantly to his feet. And collapsed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>         The
dream was more vivid than reality, intensely colored and astir with vague forms
that drifted through his mind's ken, appearing then fading. The room seemed
airless, a musk-filled cell of gilded blue panels and gold brocade. Guarded
faces hovered around and above, their eyes intense yet unseeing, distant as
stained-glass masks of cathedral sinner and saint.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>A fingertip brushed his cheek, and with its touch the room
gloried in a powerful fragrance of saffron. Then a hand, floating unattached,
gently removed his doublet; another slid away his mud-smeared breeches.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He was naked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He looked down as though from afar at the texture of chest
and thigh, and he wondered dimly if they were his own. Then other hands . . .
and suddenly he was immersed in a sea whose shores were white marble, whose
surface sheened with oil of the rose. Translucent petals drifted randomly atop
the crests. Hands toured his frame, discovering every tightened nerve, while
powdered sandalwood enveloped his hair and beard until he seemed lost in a
fragrant forest.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As suddenly as the sea had come it drew away, but now there
were steaming wraps tingling with astringent orange and clove, and he drifted
through a land of aloe balm and amber.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The room dissolved into semi-darkness, until at last only a
single face remained, a woman with eyes round and moist and coldly dark. Her
lips were the deep red of betel, while her hair was coal and braided in a skein
of jeweled tresses. A faceted stone sparkled on her left nostril, and heavy
gold rings swung gently from each ear. Henna-red nipples pressed erect against
her diaphanous blouse, and between her breasts clung a garland of pearls. The
heavy bracelets on her wrists and her upper arms glistened gold in the
flickering candlelight.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As he studied her eyes, they seemed locked into his own, and
betrayed no notice of his body. He sent his voice through the dream's carpeted
chambers, but his words were swallowed in dark air that drew out their sound
and washed it to thin silence. In a final, awkward futility he struggled to
free himself from the velvet bolster.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But gently she pressed him back.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What would you have, my love? Sweet <i>bhang </i>from
my hand?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>A cup found his lips, and before he knew he had taken more of
the incendiary green confection. Its warmth grew slowly into a pale light that
shimmered off the gilded panels and then coalesced into the rainbow now
pivoting pendulum-like above him, a glistening fan of peacock feathers swayed
by a faceless, amber-skinned woman.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>His gaze returned to the eyes, and again he searched for
sound. Then came a voice he recognized as his own.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Who are you?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You may call me Kali. Others do. It's a name you would
not understand. But can you understand that love is surrender?&quot; The words
coiled about his head, coruscating and empty of meaning. He shook them away and
watched as she brushed a strand of hair from his face. With that simple motion,
her nipples traced twin heliotrope arcs across the gossamer screen of her
blouse. He examined her in disbelief, unable to find words.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;When my lover lies silent, I do as I choose.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Deftly she uncoiled the white silk sash from around her waist
and in a single practiced motion bound it over his eyes. The room vanished. In
the dream's sudden night he grew intensely aware of touch and smell.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Commands came in an alien tongue, and he felt his breast and
thighs brushed lightly by a new, pungent fragrance.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We have cloaked you in petals of spikenard, to banish
the sight of your unshaven body. A <i>feringhi </i>knows so little of what
pleases a woman.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He felt a light brush across his parted lips, and then her
eyelashes, stiffened dark with antimony, trilled a path downward over his skin,
to his nipples. The hardened lashes stroked each nipple in turn with rapid
flutters, until the skin tightened almost to bursting. An excruciating sensitivity
burned through him, but still the lashes fluttered, determinedly, almost
unendurably, until his aroused tips touched the aching portals of pain. Then he
sensed a tongue circle each nipple in turn, searching out the one most ripe.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He felt her kneel above him, surrounding him with open thighs
that clasped his chest. The room fell expectantly silent. Then, as an unknown
syllable sounded somewhere above him, he felt the nipple of his right breast
seized in the lock of a warm, moist grasp. The surrounding thighs rocked gently
at first, but slowly increased their rhythm in time with the sound of breath.
Suddenly he felt her body twist lightly and another tip, hardened as that on
his chest, began to trace the nipple's swollen point. Her thighs were smooth
and moist as she pressed in with spiraling, ever more rapid intensity. He found
himself deeply conscious of her rhythms and the hard cadence of breath. He
reached for the strength to rip the silk from his eyes, to end the dream's
tantalizing dark. But strength was not there. Or time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Before he could stir, he sensed the hardened tip shudder.
Again a grasp took his nipple and worked it with measured spasms, until the
room's austere silence was cut by her sharp intake of breath, timed to match a
single insistent contraction that seemed to envelope the whole of his breast.
He felt her seize his hands in her own, and although he could see nothing, in
his mind there grew a vision of her eyes at that moment. Then there came a
sound, partially stifled in her throat, but not before it had found the gilded
walls and returned, annealed to a glassy relic of release.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He felt her slowly withdraw, but then her mouth took his
breast, till it had drawn away the musk. At last, perhaps to signify repletion,
she lightly brushed his lips with the tip of her tongue.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You have pleased me.&quot; Her voice was quiet now,
almost a whisper. &quot;Now we will please each other.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>A hand worked at his loins, methodically applying a viscous,
harshly scented oil.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Would you could see with my eyes. The <i>lingam </i>of
the fabled Shiva was never garlanded such as this, or anointed so
lovingly.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then her voice turned harsh as she spoke short staccato
commands in an unknown tongue. Bangles sounded and silk rustled as the room
emptied. Now he caught a new scent, the harsh smell he remembered from the box
the governor had offered.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I will tell you my secret.&quot; She whispered close to
his ear. &quot;There is no more exciting way to experience the ecstasy of love
than with <i>affion</i>, the essence of the poppy. But I have a way to receive
it no one else knows. It is like the burst of a lightning stroke. Its power
envelopes the senses.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He felt her smooth a thick paste along the sides of his
phallus, and sensed a tingle as she clasped it carefully with both hands. Again
she moved above him, but curiously there was no touch of her body. Only the
presence of her scent.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>A tight ring seemed to circle his flesh, and he felt the
weight of her rounded buttocks slide down onto his thighs.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He startled upward in shock and disbelief. Never will I . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You must lie still, my love. In your surrender, only I
may have my will.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She began at once to move above his thighs, and again muted
sounds struggled stillborn in her throat. With deliberate regularity her rhythm
mounted, while an overwhelming sensation spread upward through his body. Slowly
he felt his new <i>Resolve</i> slipping from him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The convulsions started in his lower thighs, as muscles
tightened involuntarily. And then the precipice grew near and he was at its
edge and he was falling. He felt the surge, as though drawn out by the twist of
her buttocks. Then again and again, each spasm matched by her own as she worked
to envelop him completely. He was scarcely aware of her nails fixed in his
breasts. At that instant he seemed to drift apart from his body and observe
mutely as it was consumed by its own sensations. Until numbness washed over
him, stilling his sense.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As he lay in exhaustion his mind sorted through her words,
and in the dream's darkness he vowed to take her again. The next time, it's you
who'll surrender, woman called Kali. To my will. And you'll find out the
meaning of surrender.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But his thoughts were lost among the gilded panels as she
pulled the silk from his eyes and quietly whispered something he did not
understand. In that instant he thought he saw where a tear had stained a path
across one cheek. She looked at him longingly, then touched his lips with her
own for a long moment before slipping quietly into the dark.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The dream dissolved in sleep. And she was gone. . . . </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth was suddenly awake. The chill of early dawn
penetrated his face and hands, and his hair sparkled with light jewels of dew.
His leather couch was moist and glistening, while the pale sky above was
blocked by a tapestried canopy. Only in the east, above the white railing of
the rooftop, could he see the glitter of a waning Venus, her brief reign soon
to dissolve in the red wash of early sun. He looked about his white brick
enclosure and saw only a light wooden door leading into a second-floor apartment.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He had no sooner drawn himself up to inhale the flower-
scented dawn than two smiling men were standing over him, bowing. Both wore
turbans, pastel-colored jackets, and a white wrap about their lower torso.
Squinting into their eyes, Hawksworth remembered them from the evening before.
They had brought the basin of water in which he had first washed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As he pulled the embroidered coverlet closer about him he
noticed a strange numbness in his body. And his mind ached as he tried to
remember what precisely had happened.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>There was a game on horseback with the governor, and then a
banquet, with an argument in which Mukarrab Khan threatened to betray us to the
Portugals, a curious evening of music. And then dreams . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Pulling himself up off the couch, he started unsteadily
across the hard flat tile of the roof. Immediately a servant was beside him,
producing a heavy silk wrap and swathing it around his shoulders and waist.
Then the man bowed again and spoke in accented Turki.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;May Allah prosper you today, Sahib. May your fortunes
answer the prayers of the poor.&quot; The man's expression softened to match
his own compliment. &quot;Should it please the Sahib, his morning bath is
waiting.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Without thinking, without even hearing the words, he allowed
himself to be led through the doorway into the second-floor apartment. There,
in the center of the room, was his chest, its lock intact. He examined it with
a quick glance, then followed the servants down a set of stone stairs to the
ground-floor veranda—where a steaming marble tub waited.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Good Jesus, not again! How can I make them understand?
Bathing weakens a man.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He started to turn, but suddenly two eunuchs appeared out of
nowhere and were guiding him up the two marble steps to a stone platform, where
they seated him on a filigreed wooden stool. Silently the servants stripped
away his light wrap and began to knead his body and his hair with a fragrant
powder, a blend of wood bark and some astringent fruit. The scent was mild,
pleasant, and as their hands traveled over him he felt the pores of his skin
open to divulge their residual rankness.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>This is better, he thought. Cleaning without water. With only
some sort of powder. I feel refreshed already.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>His muscles loosened as the men vigorously worked the mixture
into his skin and then carefully cleansed it away with bulky cotton towels.
Next they turned to his hair, combing and massaging more of the powder through
it strand by strand. At last they signaled for him to rise and enter the tub.
Its surface glistened with a perfumed oil, and the rising steam smelled faintly
of clove. Before he could protest, the eunuchs guided him down the marble
steps.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As he settled into the steam again he was surrounded by
waiting servants, who sprinkled more oil over the water and massaged the
emulsion into his hair and skin.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I'm being bathed in oil, he smiled, marveling. It's absurd,
yet here it seems perfectly right.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The men worked devotedly, as though he were an inanimate
utensil whose purity was their lifelong obligation. His body now glistened with
a reddish tint of the oil, matching the early glow of the sun that penetrated
the half- shuttered windows. As they motioned for him to leave the bath, he
discovered to his amazement that he would have been perfectly content to stay.
Forever. But again hands were there, guiding him, this time toward a low wooden
bench covered with thick woven tapestries.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>What now? What else can they do? I'm cleaner than the day I
was born. What more . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He was prostrate on the couch. A rough haircloth worked
against his legs and torso, sending the blood surging. At the same time, a
piece of porous sandstone in the practiced hands of another servant stripped
away the loosened calluses and scales from his boot-roughened feet. A third man
massaged still more perfumed oil, hinting of aloe and orange, into his back and
along his sides and shoulders. His body had become an invigorated, pliant reed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>They motioned for him to sit up and, as he watched, one of
the men produced a mirror and razor. Next he opened a bottle of fragrant liquid
and began to apply it to Hawksworth's beard and chest. And then also to his
legs and crotch.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What's the purpose of that razor?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We have orders to shave you, Sahib, in our
manner.&quot; The turbaned man who had greeted him that morning bowed slightly
as he signaled the barber to begin. &quot;You are to be shaved completely, as
is our custom.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Trim my beard if you like. But no more. Damn you if
you'll shave me like some catamite.&quot; Hawksworth started to rise from his
stool, but the barber was already over him, the blade flying across his face
with a menacing deftness.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It has been ordered, Sahib.&quot; The turbaned man
bowed again, and without pausing for a reply produced a short, curved metal
device and began to probe Hawksworth's ears, his face intent in concentration
as he carefully extracted an enormous ball of gray mud and encrusted sea salt.
He scraped the other ear with the same deft twist. Then he flipped the same
instrument and began to trim Hawksworth's ragged fingernails.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth turned to the mirror to discover that his beard
had already disappeared, leaving him clean-faced.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>At least I'll be in fashion back home, he thought, if I ever
get back. Beards are passing from style.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But what's he doing now? By heaven, no . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The razor swept cleanly across Hawksworth's chest, leaving a
swath of soft skin in its wake. It came down again, barely missing a nipple as
he moved to rise.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You must be still, Sahib. You will harm yourself.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I told you I'll not have it.&quot; Hawksworth pushed
the razor away.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But it is our custom.&quot; The man seemed to plead.
&quot;Khan Sahib ordered that you be groomed as an honored guest.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, damn your customs. Enough.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>There was a moment of silence. Then the turbaned man bowed,
his face despondent.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;As the Sahib desires.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He signaled the barber to rub a light coat of saffron-scented
oil on Hawksworth's face and then to begin trimming Hawksworth's hair with the
pair of silver scissors he had brought. The barber quickly snipped away the
growth of the voyage, leaving the hair moderately cropped, in the Moghul
fashion.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth examined the mirror again.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Damn if I wouldn't make a proper Cheapside dandy. Right in
style. And I hate being in style.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then the turbaned man produced a heavy lead comb and began to
work it repeatedly through Hawksworth's hair. Hawksworth watched the mirror in
confusion.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>What's he doing? It's already been combed. And it's so short
there's no point anyway.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then he noticed the slight traces of gray around the sides
beginning to darken, taking on the color of the lead.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Please open your mouth.&quot; The turbaned man stood
above him holding a dark piece of wood, frayed at the end and crooked.
&quot;And I will scrape your teeth with <i>nim</i> root.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But that's insane. Teeth are cleaned with a piece of
cloth and a toothpick. Or rubbed with a bit of sugar and salt ash . . .&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The man was scrubbing away at Hawksworth's mouth— tongue,
gums, teeth—using a dentifrice that tasted like burnt almond shells. Next he
offered a mint-flavored mouth rinse to remove the debris.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The turbaned man then inspected Hawksworth critically from
several sides, finally venturing to speak.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;If I may suggest, a bit of <i>collyrium</i>, castor oil
darkened with lampblack, would render your eyes much more striking.&quot;
Without waiting for confirmation, he applied a few quick strokes to Hawksworth's
eyelids, much as an artist might touch up a canvas.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then one of the eunuchs stepped forward and supplied a silver
tray to the turbaned servants. On it were folded garments: a tight-fitting pair
of blue trousers, a patterned shirt, and a knee-length coat of thin,
peach-colored muslin. They dressed Hawksworth quickly, and then secured a
patterned sash about his waist. Waiting on the floor were leather slippers,
low-quartered with a curved toe and a bent-down back.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What have you done with my doublet and breeches? And my
boots?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;They are being cleaned today, Sahib. You may have them
again when you wish. But you may prefer to wear our garments while our
guest.&quot; The turbaned man bowed again, then he moved away and held a long
mirror for Hawksworth to examine himself.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Have we pleased you, Sahib?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth scarcely recognized himself. He had been
transformed from a rank but honest seaman into a Moghul noble—youthful,
smooth-skinned, smelling of spice. The soreness was banished from his limbs,
and even his wound had all but disappeared. His hair was clean and completely
dark, and his skin glowed. And his new clothes were more elaborate than
anything he had ever worn.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Now if you will please follow us to the garden. Khan
Sahib has suggested you begin your day with some <i>tari </i>wine.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth followed the men through the shuttered doorway
into the open courtyard. The morning sun now illuminated the tops of a large
grove of palm trees that circled an open cistern. He quickly surveyed the
buildings, hoping to gain his bearings.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>So I've been quartered in one of the side buildings, off the
main palace. But there are many, many rooms. Who's living here?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>A group of servants stood waiting at the base of one of the
palms. When they saw Hawksworth, they mobilized to action. One young man among
them, wearing a white wrap around his lower torso, immediately secured his belt
and began to shimmy up the leaning palm. When he reached the top he locked his
legs around the trunk and carefully detached an earthen pot that hung beneath
an incision in the bark of the tree. Balancing the pot in one hand, he
stretched and nimbly pulled off a number of leaves from the tree and then
lowered himself carrying his load. The moment his feet touched ground he raced
toward the veranda and delivered the pot and leaves to a waiting eunuch.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Hawksworth watched as the eunuchs first inspected
the items and then ordered them prepared. The leaves were washed thoroughly
with water from the cistern and then folded into natural cups. The liquor from
the pot was strained through muslin into a crystal decanter and the earthen
receptacle discarded. Then one of the turbaned servants poured a large portion
of the liquor from the decanter into a palm-leaf cup and offered it to
Hawksworth.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It's <i>tari </i>wine, Sahib. One of the pleasures of
early morning in India.&quot; His matter-of-fact manner could not entirely hide
his pride. &quot;Palm wine makes itself overnight. It does not last out the
day. When the sun shines the trees only give off vinegar.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth gingerly sipped the newly fermented palm sap and
was pleasantly surprised by its light flavor, totally unlike ale, or even
Canary wine. After the third cup, the world around began to acquire a light
sparkle of its own, and he realized the sap was more potent than it seemed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Not a bad way to start the day. What do you call
it?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It comes from the <i>tari </i>palm, and some <i>topiwallahs
</i>call it Toddy.'&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Toddy, it's called? It's more than passable grog.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Thank you, Sahib. Drink too much and you will spend the
day with your head in a buzz.&quot; The servant giggled. &quot;So now perhaps
you should eat.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He consulted briefly with the eunuchs, who nodded and
signaled toward the veranda. Moments later a tray appeared, piled high with
honey-covered breads and glass dishes of sweet curds. Some hard cheese also had
found its way onto the tray, and Hawksworth wondered if this was to placate his
European taste. He sipped more of the Toddy and munched the bread and curds.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then he saw the women.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>There were five. They seemed clustered in a group as they
entered the courtyard, but then he realized it was an aristocratic lady
surrounded by four maids. They did not know he was there, for none covered her
face. As he watched them they seemed preoccupied in an increasingly animated
exchange. Then the aristocratic woman stepped determinedly ahead, turned, and
curtly gave instructions whose seriousness was clear, even if her words were
foreign. Her voice was not strident, but its authority was unmistakable.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The other women paused, then slowly, one by one, they seemed
to acknowledge her orders and they bowed. The lady whirled and continued on her
way, while the other four women turned toward the direction they had come.
Then, as though the resolution of the argument had suddenly made them aware of
their surroundings, they all seemed to see Hawksworth at once. All five women
froze.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth smiled and tried to remember the bow he had seen
performed to him so often. But he could not remove his eyes from the first
woman, who was more striking than any he had ever before seen. Her skin was
fair, with a warm hint of olive, and her high cheekbones stood in stunning
relief as they glanced away the golden light of dawn. Her nose was thin and
sculptured, while her lips would have been full, had they not been drawn tight
in response to some unspecified inner determination. Yet her eyes seemed
untouched by what had just transpired. They were clear and receptive, even
warm, and Hawksworth asked himself at that moment if this bespoke innocence, or
guile.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>In dress and adornment she scarcely differed from her maids.
All had long black hair, brushed to gleaming and protected from the morning air
with a transparent gossamer scarf edged in gold embroidery. At first glance
there seemed little to distinguish among the tight strands of pearls each wore
at the neck, or the jeweled bands on their wrists and upper arms. Each wore a
tight silk halter for a blouse, and to Hawksworth's assessing eyes the maids
all seemed to have abundant breasts swelling their halters to overflowing, some—perhaps
all—with breasts more generous than the lady herself. Then he noted in
amazement that the women actually wore a form of tapered silk trouser, a
tight-legged pajama similar to that worn by aristocratic men.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Unlike the male style, however, each woman's body was
enveloped by a long transparent skirt, suspended from a</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>band that
circled her torso just beneath her breasts. And whereas men all wore a long
scarf tied about the waist of their cloaks and hanging down the front, the
women all had a long pleated panel tucked directly into the front waistband of
their trousers and reaching almost to the ground. He could not help noticing
that it clung sensually to their thighs as they walked, while its
gold-embroidered hem tinkled against the gold bracelets each woman wore at her
ankles. Their shoes were red Turkish leather, with gold decorations sewn across
the top and a pointed toe that curved upward.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The only difference between the lady and her maids seemed to
be in the rich fabric of her lightly clinging trousers. Then, too, there was
slightly more gold thread in her long transparent skirt, and among the pearls
at her neck nestled an unmistakable blue sapphire as large as a walnut.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But her primary distinction was not merely the classic lines
of her face or the perfect curve of her waist and thighs, but rather something
in her bearing, in her assured but unmannered carriage. Her real beauty lay in
her breeding.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>All five women stared at Hawksworth in momentary surprise and
shock. Then each maid automatically seized her transparent scarf and pulled it
across her lower face. The woman also moved instinctively to do the same, but
then she seemed to consciously stop herself and with an obvious attempt at
restraint she walked on, barefaced, past the courtyard and into the garden
beyond. Alone.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth watched her form disappear among the clipped
hedges and elaborate marble pavilions of the garden. He noticed a curious
sensation in his chest as she passed from view, and he suddenly found himself
wanting very much to follow her. When he finally turned and looked back, the
other women had already vanished.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Only then did he realize that all the servants had been
watching him. The one nearest nodded in the direction of the garden and smiled
knowingly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Perhaps it will not surprise you, Sahib, to learn that
she was once the favorite of the Moghul himself. And now she is in Surat.
Amazing.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But why's she here?&quot; Hawksworth glanced back at
the</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>garden once
more to assure himself she was indeed lost to its recesses.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;She is Shirin, the first wife of Khan Sahib.&quot; He
moved closer to Hawksworth, so that his lowered voice would not reach the
eunuchs. &quot;She was removed from the Moghul’s <i>zenana </i>and married to
Khan Sahib last year by Queen Janahara, just before Her Majesty had him appointed
the governor of Surat. Some believe she appointed him here to remove Shirin
from Agra, because she feared her.&quot; The servant's voice became a whisper.
&quot;We all know she has refused His Excellency the legal rights of a
husband.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The silence of the court was cut by the unmistakable voice of
Mukarrab Khan, sounding in anger as he gave some command from within the
palace. There followed a chorus of women's wails.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth turned to the servant, but the man read his
inquiring glance.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;He has ordered the women whipped for disobeying his
order to accompany Shirin at all times, even when she walks in the
garden.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then the door opened again, and Mukarrab Khan strode into the
morning sunshine.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Captain Hawksworth, <i>salaam</i>. I trust Allah gave
you rest.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I slept so well I find difficulty remembering all we
said last night.&quot; Hawksworth watched him carefully. Will he honor his
threat to deliver us to the Viceroy, for a trial at Goa?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It was an amusing evening. Hardly a time for weighty
diplomatic exchange. And did you enjoy my little present?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth pondered his question for a moment, and the
drugged dream of the night before suddenly became real.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You mean the woman? She was very . . . unusual, very
different from the women of England.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Yes, I daresay. She was one of my final gifts from . .
. Agra. I often have her entertain my guests. If you like, you may keep her
while you stay with me. I already hear she fancies you. The serving women call
her Kali, after a goddess from their infidel pantheon. I think that one's their
deity of destruction.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Why did they give her that name?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Perhaps she'll tell you herself sometime.&quot;
Mukarrab Khan gestured for a servant to bring his cloak. &quot;I hope you'll
forgive me, but I regret I must abandon you for a time. Among my least pleasant
duties is a monthly journey to Cambay, our northern port in this province. It
always requires almost a week, but I have no choice. Their Shahbandar would rob
the Moghul’s treasury itself if he were not watched. But I think you'll enjoy
yourself in my absence.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I would enjoy it more if I could be with my men.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And forgo the endless intrigues my Kali undoubtedly
plans for you?&quot; He monitored Hawksworth's unsettled expression. &quot;Or
perhaps it's a boy you'd prefer. Very well, if you wish you may even have . .
.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm more interested in the safety of our merchants and
seamen. And our cargo. I haven't seen the men since yesterday, at the customs
house.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;They're all quite well. I've lodged them with a port
official who speaks Portuguese, which your Chief Merchant also seems to
understand. I'm told, by the way, he's a thoroughly unpleasant specimen.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;When can I see them?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Why any time you choose. You have only to speak to one
of the eunuchs. But why trouble yourself today? Spend it here and rest. Perhaps
enjoy the grounds and the garden. Tomorrow is time enough to re-enter the
wearisome halls of commerce.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth decided that the time had come to raise the
critical question. &quot;And what about the Portugals? And their false
charges?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I think that tiresome matter can be <i>Resolve</i>d
with time. I've sent notice to the court in Agra, officially, that you wish to
travel there. When the reply is received, matters can be settled. In the
meantime, I must insist you stay here in the palace. It's a matter of your
position. And frankly, your safety. The Portuguese do not always employ upright
means to achieve their ends.&quot; He tightened his traveling cloak.
&quot;Don't worry yourself unduly. Just try to make the most of my humble
hospitality. The palace grounds are at your disposal. Perhaps you'll find
something in all this to engage your curiosity.&quot; Mukarrab Khan brushed
away a fly from his cloak. &quot;There's the garden. And if you're bored by
that, then you might wish to examine the Persian observatory constructed by my predecessor.
You're a seaman and, I presume, a navigator. Perhaps you can fathom how it all
works. I've never been able to make anything out of it. Ask the servants to
show you. Or just have some <i>tari</i> wine on the veranda and enjoy the
view.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>He bowed with official decorum and was gone, his
entourage of guards in tow.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth turned to see the servants waiting politely. The
turbaned man, whose high forehead and noble visage were even more striking now
in the direct sunshine, was dictating in a low voice to the others, discreetly
translating Mukarrab Khan's orders into Hindi, the language that seemed common
to all the servants.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The palace and its grounds are at your disposal,
Sahib.&quot; The servant with the large white turban stood waiting. &quot;Our
pleasure is to serve you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'd like to be alone for a while. To think about . . .
to enjoy the beauty of the garden.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Of course. Sahib. Perhaps I could have the honor of
being your guide.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I think I'd prefer to see it alone.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The servant's dismay was transparent, but he merely bowed and
immediately seemed to dissolve into the marble porticoes of the veranda, as did
all the others.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth watched in amazement. They really do follow
orders. Now if I can start to figure out this place. I don't need guides. All I
need are my eyes. And luck.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The garden spread out before him. Unlike the closely clipped
geometry of the courtyard he had seen the night before, this was less formal
and more natural, with a long waterway receding into the horizon. The pond was
flanked by parallel arbors along each side, shading wide, paved walkways. He
noticed there were no flowers, the main focus in an English garden, only gravel
walks and the marble-tiled watercourse. The sense was one of sublime control.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Several dark-skinned gardeners in loincloths were wading
knee-deep in the shallow reservoir, adjusting the flow from bubbling fountains
that spewed from its surface at geometrically regular spacings, while others
were intently pruning—in what seemed a superfluous, almost compulsive act—the
already immaculate hedges.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As Hawksworth walked past, self-consciously trying to absorb
a sense of place, the gardeners appraised him mutely with quick, flicking
sweeps of their eyes. But none made any move to acknowledge his presence.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The sun burned through the almost limitless sky, whose blue
was polished to a ceramic glaze, and the air was clean and perfumed with
nectar. The garden lay about him like a mosaic of naturalism perfected. Through
the conspicuous hand of man, nature had been coerced, or charmed, to exquisite
refinement.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The gravel pathway ended abruptly as he reached the pond's
far shore, terminated by a row of marble flagstones. Beyond lay geometrical
arbors of fruit-laden trees— mangoes, apples, pears, lemons, and even oranges.
Hawksworth tightened his new robe about his waist and entered one of the
orchard's many pathways, marveling.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I've found the Garden of Eden.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The rows of trees spread out in perfect regularity, squared
as carefully as the columns of the palace verandas and organized by species of
fruit. As he explored the man-made forest, he began to find its regularity
satisfying and curiously calming. Then in the distance, over the treetops, a
high stone wall came into view, and from beyond could be heard the splashes of
men laboring in the moat. He realized he had reached the farthest extent of the
palace grounds.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As he neared the wall, the orchard gave way to an abandoned
clearing in whose center stood a moss-covered marble stairway projecting upward
into space, leading nowhere. The original polish on its steps was now buried in
layers of dust and overgrowth.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Was there once a villa here? But where's the . . . ?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then he saw the rest. Curving upward on either side of the
stairway was a moss-covered band of marble over two feet wide and almost twenty
feet in length, concave, etched, and numbered.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It's some sort of sundial. But it's enormous.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He turned and realized he was standing next to yet another
stone instrument, a round plaque in red and white marble, like the dial of a
water clock, on which Persian symbols for the zodiac had been inscribed. And
beyond that was the remains of a circular building, perforated with dozens of
doorways, with a tall pillar in the middle. Next to it was a shallow marble
well, half a hemisphere sunk into the ground, with precise gradations etched
all across the bottom.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth walked in among the marble instruments, his
astonishment growing. They were all etched to a precision he had never before
seen in stone.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>This observatory is incredible. The sundial is obvious, even if
the purpose of the stairway over its center isn't. But what's the round
vertical plaque? Or that round building there, and the curious marble well?
Could those be some sort of Persian astrolabe, like navigators use to estimate
latitude by fixing the elevation of the sun or stars?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>What are they all for? Some to fix stars? Others to predict
eclipses? But there has to be more. These are for observation. Which means
there have to be charts. Or computations? Or something.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It's said the Persians once mastered a level of mathematics
and astronomy far beyond anything known in Europe. Is this some forgotten
outpost of that time? Just waiting to be rediscovered?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He turned and examined the instruments again, finding himself
wondering for an instant if they could somehow be hoisted aboard the <i>Discovery</i>
and returned to England.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>And if the observatory's still here, perhaps the charts are
here somewhere too.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>His excitement mounted as he searched the rest of the
clearing. Then he saw what he wanted.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It has to be there.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Abutting the stone wall was a small hut of rough-hewn stone,
with slatted windows and a weathered wooden door that was wedged ajar, its base
permanently encrusted in the dried mud of the rainy season. The wall behind was
so weathered that the metal spikes along its top had actually rusted away.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>This whole place must have been deserted for years. What a
waste.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As he approached the weathered stone hut, he tried to dampen
his own hopes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>How can there be anything left? Who knows how long it's been
abandoned? And even if there are calculations—or maybe even books!—they're most
likely written in Persian. Or Arabic.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He took hold of the rotting door, which left a layer of
decaying wood on his hand, and wrenched it open wider, kicking a path for its
base through the crusted mud. Then he slipped sideways through the opening.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>A stifled, startled cry cut the dense air of the hut, and an
oil lamp glowing in the black was smothered in a single movement. Then came a
woman's voice.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You're not allowed here. Servants are forbidden beyond
the orchard.&quot; She had begun in Persian, then repeated herself in Hindi.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Who are you?&quot; Hawksworth, startled by the unknown
languages, began in English and then switched to Turkish. &quot;I thought . .
.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The English <i>feringhi</i>.&quot; The voice suddenly
found control, and its Turki was flawless. &quot;You were in the courtyard this
morning.&quot; She advanced slowly toward the shaft of light from the doorway.
&quot;What are you doing here? Khan Sahib could have you killed if the eunuchs
discover you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He watched as her face emerged from the shadows. Then his
heart skipped.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It was Shirin.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The govern . . . Khan Sahib told me about this
observatory. He said I . . .&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Stars do not shine in the day, nor the sun in this
room. What are you doing in here?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I thought there might be charts, or a library.&quot;
Hawksworth heard his own voice echo against the raw stone walls of the room. He
studied her face in the half light, realizing with a shock that she was even
more striking now than in the sunshine of the garden.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Did he also tell you to plunder all you find in the
palace grounds?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;He said I might find the observatory curious, as a
navigator. He was right. But there must be some charts. I thought this room
might . . .&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;There are some old papers here. Perhaps he thought this
place would keep you occupied. Or test you one more time.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What do you mean?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She answered with a hard laugh, then circled Hawksworth and
examined him in the glancing morning light. Her dark hair was backlighted now
from the sun streaming through the doorway, her gauze head scarf glistening
like spun gold.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Yes, you're a <i>feringhi</i>. Just like all the
rest.&quot; Her eyes flashed. &quot;How many more like you are there in Europe?
Enough, I would guess, to amuse our debauched governor forever.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I didn't double the Cape for his amusement. Or
yours.&quot; What's the matter? Everybody talks in riddles. &quot;Does this
room have a library?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Yes, but the writings are in Persian. Which you don't
understand.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;How do you know what I understand?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She looked at him with open astonishment. &quot;Do you
suppose there's anyone in the palace who doesn't already know all about
you?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And what do you know about me?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Silence held the room for a moment. Then she spoke.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I know you're a <i>feringhi</i>. Like the Portuguese.
Here for gold. And . . . the rest.&quot; She turned and walked back into the
darkness. There was a spark of light and the lamp glowed again. &quot;As for
this room, there's nothing here you would understand. And when you return to
the palace, and to His Excellency's <i>affion </i>and his <i>nautch </i>girls,
remember what happens to a man who is discovered with another's wife. I will
forget I saw you here. You should forget also, if you wish to see the sun
tomorrow.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth found himself watching her spellbound, almost not
hearing her words. He stood motionless for a moment, then walked directly
toward her, trying not to feel self-conscious in his new Moghul clothes.
&quot;I want to talk with you. To find out what's going on. I'll begin with
this place. It's an observatory, or was. What harm can there be in looking around
this room?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She stared at him without moving. &quot;You certainly have a <i>feringhi’</i>s
manner. If you won't leave, then I'll ask you some questions. What do you say
is your reason for coming to India? It's rumored you're here for the English
king.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What else have you heard?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Other things as well.&quot; She moved closer and her
perfume enveloped him. Her eyes were intense, almost overwhelming the jewel at
her throat. &quot;But I'd like to hear them from you. There's much dismay about
you, about the battle, about the letter.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth studied her wistfully. &quot;You know about the
letter?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Of course. Everyone knows.&quot; She sighed at his
naivete. &quot;The contents of your chest were examined very carefully last
night . . . but no one dared touch the seal on the letter, for fear of the Moghul.
Is it true the English king may send an armada to attack Goa?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And if it were?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It could make a great deal of difference. To many
people here.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Who?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;People who matter.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The only one who should matter is the Moghul.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She laughed again. &quot;He's the very last one who matters.
I see you comprehend very little.&quot; She paused and examined him closely.
&quot;But you're an interesting man. We all listened to you play the English
sitar last night. And today the first place you chose to come was here. You're
the first <i>feringhi</i> ever to seek out this place, which was once famous
throughout India. Did you truly come here this morning just to learn?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>        
&quot;I haven't learned very much so far. At least in this room.&quot; He
looked about them, noticing for the first time a small table on which there was
a book and fresh writings. &quot;You've not told what you're doing here. Or why
you can come here when the servants are forbidden.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>        
&quot;Servants once tried to steal some of the marble steps for a house. But
the reason I come here is not really your concern, Captain Hawksworth. . .
.&quot; She caught his startled look and laughed. &quot;Of course I know your
name. I also know you should learn not to drink <i>bhang</i> with Kali. She's
more than your equal.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Hawksworth stifled his embarrassment and tried to ignore
the barb. &quot;There surely must be charts here. What harm if I merely look
around?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>       
Shirin stiffened. &quot;Not now. Not today. You have to leave.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>       
&quot;But are there calculations, or charts?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>       
&quot;More than likely. But I told you they're in Persian.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>        
&quot;Then maybe you could translate.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>        
&quot;I could. But not today. I've told you, you have to leave. Really you
must.&quot; She pushed the door open wider and stood waiting.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>       
&quot;I'll be back.&quot; He paused in the doorway and turned. &quot;Will you
be here tomorrow?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>       
&quot;Possibly.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>       
&quot;Then I'll be back for sure.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>        She
looked at him and shook her head resignedly. &quot;You truly don't realize how
dangerous it is for you to come here.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>        
&quot;Are you afraid?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>         &quot;I'm
always afraid. You should be too.&quot; She studied him in the sunshine,
examining his eyes, and for a moment her face softened slightly. &quot;But if
you do come, will you bring your English sitar? I'd like very much to hear it
once more.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>      
&quot;And what will you do for me in return?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>       She
laughed. &quot;I'll try to excavate some musty Persian books here that might
tell you something about the observatory. But remember. No one must ever know.
Now, please.&quot; She urged him out, then reached and pulled the door tightly
closed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth suddenly realized the heat had grown intense, and
now the sun cut a sharp line down the face of the red marble dial, telling that
midmorning approached. He examined the dial quickly and then turned to look
again at the stone hut.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>With the door closed, the ramshackle hut again looked
completely deserted.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>What in Christ's name can she be doing? No matter, she's
astonishing. And there's something in the way she handles herself. Little
wonder she was the favorite concubine, or whatever they call it, of the Moghul.
And it's easy to see why his queen married her off to Mukarrab Khan and sent
them both here to get her out of the way. A clever way to banish . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth froze.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>That's the word the pilot Karim used! From the Quran. &quot;As
for women from whom you fear rebellion, banish them to . . . beds apart.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Could this be the woman he meant? But what rebellion?
Whatever's going on, nobody's talking. All I see are armed guards. And fear.
This palace is like a jewel-set dagger-exquisite, and deadly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He stared again at the moss-covered marble instruments.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But I'll be back. If she'll be here, absolutely nothing could
stop me.</span></p>

<h2><a name=bookmark10>&nbsp;</a></h2>

<h2><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>CHAPTER NINE</span></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>       The
two <i>chitahs </i>tensed at the same instant and pulled taut the chains on
their jewel-studded collars. They were tawny, dark-spotted Indian hunting
leopards, and they rode in carpeted litters, one on each side of the elephant's
back. Each wore a brocade saddlecloth signifying its rank, and now both began
to flick the black-and-white striped tips of their tails in anticipation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Prince Jadar caught their motion and reined in his dun
stallion; the bright morning sunshine glanced off his freshly oiled olive skin
and highlighted the crevices of his lean angular face and his tightly trimmed
short beard. He wore a forest-green hunting turban, secured with a heavy strand
of pearls, and a dark green jacket emblazoned with his own royal crest. His
fifty-man Rajput guard had drawn alongside, and their horses tossed their heads
and pawed impatiently, rattling the arrows in the brocade quivers by each man's
saddle.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then Jadar spotted the <i>nilgai</i>, large bovine Indian
deer, grazing in a herd upwind near the base of a low-lying hill. With a flick
of his hand he signaled the keepers who rode alongside the  to begin removing
the leopards' saddlecloths. He watched as first the male and then the female
shook themselves and stretched their paws in readiness.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Fifty rupees the male will make the first kill.&quot;
Jadar spoke quietly to Vasant Rao, the moustachioed young Rajput captain who
rode alongside. The commander of the prince's personal guards, he was the only
man in India Jadar trusted fully.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then give me two hundred on the female, Highness.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;A hundred. And half the hides for your regiment's shield
maker.&quot; Jadar turned toward the waiting keepers. &quot;Release the female.
Then count to a hundred and release the male.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>In moments the <i>chitahs </i>were bulleting toward the
unsuspecting deer, darting from bush to bush, occasionally kicking up dust with
their forefeet and hind legs to create camouflage. Then, as they approached the
final clearing, they suddenly parted—the female to the north, the male to the
south. Seconds later, as though on some private signal, the female sprang. She
seemed to cover the remaining twenty yards in less than a second, and before
the <i>nilgai </i>realized she was there, she had already pawed down a bleating
straggler.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The striped ears of the other <i>nilgai </i>shot erect at the
sound, and the herd panicked, sweeping blindly away from her—and directly
toward the cover where the male crouched. He waited coolly, and then, as the
deer darted by, pounced.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>        
What followed was a fearsome devastation, as he brought down one after another
of the confused prey with his powerful claws.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The female killed first, Highness. I assume our bet was
in gold coins, not silver.&quot; Vasant Rao laughed lightly and turned to study
the brooding man at his side. Can it be true what many suspect about the
prince? he again found himself wondering. That he choses his strategy for a
campaign from the final hunt of his <i>chitahs</i>!</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>But what strategy is left for us? The Deccanis have
already reclaimed the city of Ahmadnagar, deep in their territory, and once
again made it their rebel capital. They drove the Moghul garrison north to the
fort at Burhanpur, and now they threaten that city as well, the most important
station in the vital route between Agra and Surat. We haven't the men and horse
to turn them back. Not this time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>This was Prince Jadar's second campaign in the Deccan,
India's revolt-torn central plains, which lay far south of Agra and east of the
port of Surat, and the second time he had led his army to regain cities lost to
Malik Ambar, the Abyssinian adventurer and military genius who periodically
rose to lead the Deccan against Moghul rule. The Deccan had never been secure,
even under the Moghurs father, Akman, but under Arangbar it had become a burial
ground of reputation. One of the Moghurs finest generals, whose dispatches from
Ahmadnagar, only the previous year, had boasted that the Deccan was finally
subdued, now cowered in the fortress at Burhanpur. Arangbar had no choice but
to send Jadar again.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Did you see how they planned their attack?&quot; Jadar
fingered the edges of his short beard, then pointed. &quot;She drove them
toward his trap. By attacking the weak, she frightened the strong, who flew to
their doom.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We're not facing <i>nilgai</i>, Highness.&quot; Vasant
Rao shifted in his saddle to face the prince and shielded his eyes against the
sun. &quot;And our position is much worse than on the last campaign. This time
we have only eighteen thousand men, all encamped here at Ujjain, all weary to
their bones from our siege at the Kangra, north in the Punjab, and then the
long march down country. While Malik Ambar waits rested and secure in
Ahmadnagar, his own capital, a two months' march south.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We'll bring Ambar to terms just as before, three years
ago. By fear.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Jadar watched as the keepers began measuring the rations of
meat to reward the <i>chitahs</i>. And he reflected over the secret envoy
received early that morning from the commander of the fortress at Mandu, the
northern outpost of the Deccan. . . . </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Your Highness is respectfully advised the situation is
worse, much worse, than told in the reports sent by Ghulam Adl.&quot; They were
alone in Jadar's tent and the envoy was on his knees, prostrate, terrified at
his obligation to bring ill tidings to the son of the Moghul. Ghulam Adl was
the general in charge of the Deccan, who had abandoned Ahmadnagar to Malik
Ambar and retreated north to Burhanpur. His official reports still maintained
an air of bravado, claiming a few reinforcements were all that was required to
drive the rebels to final extinction.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We have asked Ghulam Adl for troops to help defend
Mandu, but he cannot leave Burhanpur,&quot; the envoy continued. &quot;The
Deccanis have surrounded the city, but they do not trouble themselves with a
siege. They know he cannot move. So they have sent eight thousand light
cavalry, Maratha irregulars, north across the Narbada River to plunder outlying
districts. They are approaching Mandu, and will be at the fortress within the
week.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Why doesn't Ghulam Adl call up troops from among the <i>mansabdars</i>.
They've all been granted their annual allowance for maintenance of
cavalry.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Mansabdars </span></i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>were nobles of the Moghul empire who had been given rank by
the Moghul and were allowed to collect revenue from a specified number of
estates and villages, allotted lands called <i>jagirs</i>, as a reward for
service and loyalty. They collected taxes for the Imperial treasury in Agra,
which allowed them a portion to maintain cavalry and equipage at the ready.
Assignment of a <i>jagir </i>always carried the responsibility of maintaining a
specified number of troops and cavalry, which they were obliged to muster when
requested by the Moghul.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The <i>mansabdars</i> have no men to muster, may it
please Your Highness.&quot; The envoy's face was buried in the carpet, showing
to Jadar only the dust-covered back of his turban. &quot;Conditions have been
severe over the past year. Crops have been bad, and many <i>mansabdars </i>could
not collect taxes because of the Deccani raids. Many have not paid their
cavalry for over a year. The <i>mansabdars </i>still feed the horses that have
been branded and placed in their care. But they have not fed the men who must
ride. Most of those have returned to their villages. There can be no army
without coin to lure them back. The <i>mansabdars </i>are fearful of Malik
Ambar now, and many have secretly agreed with him not to muster even the troops
they still have.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;How many Deccani troops are encamped around
Burhanpur?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Our spies report as many as eighty thousand, Highness.
Ghulam Adl dares not leave the fort in the center of the city. He has no more
than five thousand men still remaining loyal, and his supplies are short.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Jadar had ordered immediate solitary confinement for the
envoy, lest the news reach the camp. Now, watching his <i>chitahs </i>feed, he
calculated his next move.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I have to requisition silver coin from the treasury at Agra,
and hope a supply caravan can still get through. In the meantime I'll muster
the remaining cavalry from the <i>mansabdars</i>, on the threat their <i>jagirs</i>
will be confiscated if they fail to deliver. It won't raise many men, but it
will slow defections.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But if we're to recall the men still loyal, we must have
silver. To raise the thirty thousand men we need, men who've not been paid for
a year, will require at least five million rupees, fifty <i>lakhs</i>. I must
have it by the time we reach Burhanpur. If we can hold that city, we can raise
the army from there.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Malik Ambar sued for peace three years ago because his
alliance came apart.&quot; Vasant Rao spoke again, watching Jadar carefully,
knowing that the prince was deeply troubled, had imprisoned a courier that very
morning for which there could only be one reason—then released pigeons that
flew north.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And his alliance will come apart again. If we sow
enough fear.&quot; Jadar seemed annoyed at the delay as the waiting <i>chitahs </i>were
re-harnessed and the last carcasses of blue <i>nilgai </i>were loaded onto the
ox-drawn wagons for return to the camp. &quot;You still haven't learned to
think like a <i>chitah</i>.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Jadar signaled the hunt was finished and wheeled his horse
back toward the camp. Vasant Rao rode a few paces behind, asking himself how
long that regal head would remain on those royal shoulders.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>You're threatened now on every side. You cannot be as
oblivious as you seem.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He thought back over Prince Jadar's career. Of the Moghul’s
four sons, Prince Jadar was the obvious one to succeed. Jadar's elder brother
Khusrav had been blinded by the Moghul years before for attempting a palace
revolt. Jadar's brother Parwaz, also older than the prince, was a notorious
drunkard and unacceptably dissolute, even by the lax standards of the Moghul’s
court. And Jadar's younger brother, Allaudin, was the handsome but witless son
of a concubine, who well deserved his secret nickname, Nashu-dani, &quot;the
good-for-nothing.&quot; Since there was no law in India that the oldest must
automatically succeed, power devolved to the fittest. Only Jadar, son of a
royal Rajput mother, could lead an army, or rule India. Among the Moghul’s four
sons, he was the obvious, deserving heir.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But ability alone was never enough to ensure success in the
mire of palace intrigue. One must also have a powerful friend.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>For years Prince Jadar had the most powerful friend of all.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The grooming of Jadar for office had begun over five years
earlier, when he was taken under the protection of Queen Janahara. She had made
herself the guardian of Jadar's interests at court; and two years ago she had
induced the Moghul to elevate Jadar's <i>mansab</i>, his honorary rank, to
twelve thousand <i>zat</i>. In income and prestige he had soared far beyond his
brothers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As is always the case, Jadar was expected to repay his
obligation. On the day he ascended to the throne and assumed power from the
ailing, opium-sotted Arangbar, he was expected to share that power with Queen
Janahara.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But their unofficial alliance had begun to go wrong. Very
wrong. And what had gone wrong was the most obvious problem of all. Jadar had
lived half his life in army camps, fighting the Moghul’s wars because he was
the only son who could fight them, and he no longer saw any reason to
relinquish his battle-earned inheritance to the queen.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>What will the queen do? Vasant Rao asked himself again. I
know she has turned on the prince. I know she tried to marry her Persian
daughter to Jadar's blinded brother Khusrav, but Jadar discovered this and
demanded Khusrav be sent out of Agra, to be kept in confinement by a raja loyal
to the prince. But the queen is still in Agra, and sooner or later she will
produce another successor, a creature she can dominate. Her task will be easy
if Jadar fails in this campaign.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I have reports Maratha irregulars may be at the fort at
Mandu within a week.&quot; Jadar broke the silence between them as they rode.
The noisy Rajput horsemen rode discreetly well behind, cursing, laughing,
wagering. The flawless blue sky seemed to cloud as Jadar spoke. &quot;Tell me
what you would do?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Strike camp and march south. We have no choice.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Sometimes you Rajputs show less wit than your monkey
god, Hanumanji.&quot; Jadar laughed good-naturedly. &quot;You learned nothing
from the hunt today. Don't you see that would merely scatter them? They'll
never dare meet us if we march in force. They'll only stage small raids. Harass
our baggage train. No, we must do just the opposite.&quot; Jadar reined in his
horse, turned to Vasant Rao, and lowered his voice. &quot;Think like a <i>chitah
</i>for once, not like an impulsive Rajput. We'll send a small cavalry force
only—five hundred horse, you will help me pick them—who will disperse, ride
separately, never show their numbers. Like a <i>chitah </i>stalks. No supply
contingent. No elephants. No wagons. And, after the Marathas have set their
siege at Mandu, our cavalry will quietly group and attack their flank. As they
fall back, which they always do when facing a disciplined unit, the cavalry in
the fort will ride out in force, forming the second arm of a pincer. And that
will be the last we see of Malik Ambar's famous Maratha irregulars. They'll
return to pillaging baggage trains and helpless villages.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And after that?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We'll march directly on Burhanpur. We should reach it
in less than a month.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The Marathas will begin to harass our supply trains as
soon as we cross the Narbada River. If they don't attack us while we cross.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;After Mandu, that's the one thing they will not do.
Remember the <i>chitahs</i>. The Marathas will never know where our Mandu
cavalry may be waiting in ambush.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;And when we reach Burhanpur?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We'll make our camp there, and muster cavalry from all
the <i>mansabdars</i>.&quot; Jadar passed over how he intended to do this.
&quot;That will be the end of Ambar's many alliances. We'll have the men we
need to march in force on the south, on to Ahmadnagar, within the week. And
Malik Ambar will sue for peace and return the territory he's seized, just like
before.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Vasant Rao nodded in silent acknowledgment, asking himself
what the prince was withholding. The strategy was far too straightforward for
Jadar.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The camp was coming into view now. A vast movable city, it
was easily several miles in circuit. Even from afar, however, Jadar's massive
central tent dominated. It was bright red and stationed in the center of the <i>gulal
bar</i>, a restricted central zone almost two hundred yards on the side that
formed the focal point of the camp. Behind Jadar's tent, separated by a figured
satin partition, were the red chintz tents of the women, where his first wife,
Mumtaz, and her attendants stayed. Directly in front of Jadar's tent was a
canopied platform with four massive corner pillars, called the <i>sarachah</i>,
where Jadar held private briefings.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The entire <i>gulal</i> <i>bar </i>was sealed from common
view by a</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>high cloth wall. Near the entrance to Jadar's enclosure
was the camp artillery, including the cannon, and the tents of the lead horses
and war elephants. Its entry was guarded by mounted horsemen, and next to these
were the tents for Jadar's leopards. Around the perimeter were the striped
tents of the nobles and officers, whose respective colors flew above for easy
identification. And spreading out from each officer's tent were the tents of
his men, their wives, and their bazaar. The camp itself was laid out with such
consistent precision that a soldier might easily find his tent in total
darkness, regardless of where the army might be.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As Jadar dismounted at the entry to the gulal bar and strode
toward his tent, his mind sorted through the moves that lay ahead. He had
notified the Moghul of the envoy's secret report and asked for five million
rupees in silver coin. It was the price for the Deccan. Surely he could not
refuse. Arangbar's own administrators, who were supposed to monitor the
mansabdars, were to blame.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>There were also other, new and disquieting, complexities.
Word had come through Surat only the day before that the Portuguese were
secretly planning to arm Malik Ambar. Why? It was common knowledge they feared
and hated Jadar, because he distrusted all Christians and said so. And they
certainly were aware that if he should someday unite the rebel-infested
province of Gujarat, where their ports of Daimon and Diu were situated, he
would undoubtedly try to regain these ports for India. But they would not dare
to openly, or even secretly, support rebels within the Moghul empire unless
they were sure there would be no reprisals from Agra. Which meant they had
powerful accomplices in court. Accomplices who would venture to endanger the
empire itself to ruin Jadar.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Whose interests in Agra were served if the Deccan remained in
turmoil? If Jadar were kept occupied and harried in the south?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The question virtually answered itself.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>If this were not perplexing enough, news had arrived two days
before telling of an incredible incident. Two merchant frigates of another
European nation, calling themselves English, had appeared off the bar of Surat.
And humiliated four Portuguese warships. Jadar had released pigeons for Surat
immediately, ordering that the English be protected until he could determine
their intentions.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The dispatch received the following morning, yesterday,
reported that his orders had been timely. A Portuguese ambush of the English as
they came up the Tapti River had been averted, by Rajputs using arrows stolen
from the governor's own guard. And this morning there had been another message
from Surat, with news that the governor had sent the Moghul a dispatch claiming
credit for the action—this only after he discovered the English captain had
gifts for Arangbar!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But who knew the intentions of the captain of this English
fleet? Or the content of a letter he had brought for the Moghul. Reports said
only that he was &quot;quartered&quot; in the governor's palace. Where he could
no longer be protected. . . . </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>His eunuchs bowed and relayed an urgent message from Mumtaz.
His wife begged to receive His Highness the moment he returned.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Without entering his own tent, Jadar proceeded through the
circle of guards protecting the women's quarters. Mumtaz was waiting,
surrounded by two of her women and the now-constant midwife. She was almost to
term with Jadar's third child. The first two had been daughters. His first
thought when he saw her was that this birth must be male. Merciful Allah, make
this a son.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Mumtaz's gleaming black hair had been tightly braided, and
she wore a shawl and trousers of gold-threaded silk. She had a pronounced
fondness for gold and silk: few other luxuries were to be found in the army
camps that had been her home for most of their marriage. Mumtaz's features were
delicate, with high Persian cheeks, and she was well over thirty—the age at
which most Muslim women ceased to interest their mates. But she had found ways
to remain the center of Jadar's life, if not dominate it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The flash of her eyes told Jadar she was in an extreme
temper.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Pigeons arrived just after you left. The report from
Agra</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>is
astonishing.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What 'report' do you mean? Do you and your women
receive my dispatches now?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Which are rarely worth the bother. No, I receive my
own. From Father.&quot; Mumtaz was the daughter of Nadir Sharif, prime minister
of the Moghul empire and brother of Queen Janahara. &quot;I had the sense to
leave him pigeons for here at Ujjain. And also for Burhanpur . . . which may
prove to be vital for you, assuming that city is not overrun by Deccanis by the
time you reach it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What message did Nadir Sharif ever send that wasn't
dictated by our noble queen?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You're a fool not to trust him. But you'd do well to
begin. And soon.&quot; Mumtaz's eyes snapped momentary fire, matching the hard
red jewel on her forehead, and she eased herself slowly onto a well-traveled
velvet bolster to lighten the weight of the child. &quot;I think you'll discover
your many friends may be difficult to find if we ever return to the
capital.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Come to the point. I want to see into their tent. They
killed well today.&quot; Jadar was always amused by Mumtaz's temper. He had
long ago despaired of receiving proper respect from her. She defied him exactly
the way Janahara defied the Moghul. And he delighted in it. Perhaps all Persian
wives were incorrigible. Perhaps it was a racial trait.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Very well. You should be pleased to know that His
Majesty has already forgotten you exist. He has agreed to the queen's
outrageous scheme. An affront to sense, but it will be the end of you
nonetheless.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Agreed to what?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The very marriage I warned you about, but you wouldn't
listen. You were too clever. Yes, you were brilliant. You sent the wrong
brother away from Agra. You sent Khusrav, the competent one. You should have
sent Allaudin.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I don't believe it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I do. And I told you it would happen. The queen has
foisted her scrawny offspring, the simpering Princess Layla, onto Allaudin. But
it's the perfect match. The Moghul’s youngest son, the notorious
'good-for-nothing,' betrothed to that fumbling little sparrow. Both weak and
useless.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What could Allaudin possibly do? Even Arangbar realizes
he's incompetent.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But Arangbar will soon be dead. So what he knows won't
matter. It's perfect for the queen. She'll rule them both. In the meantime,
she'll make sure you're nowhere near Agra. Your next appointment will probably
be the Punjab, or perhaps the Himalayas. Where you can chase yak with your
leopards.&quot; Mumtaz could scarcely contain her anger and frustration.
&quot;The time will come, and soon, when the Moghul will chance his twenty
glasses of wine and his twelve grains of opium one night too many. And the next
day, while you're somewhere sporting with your <i>chitahs</i>, she'll summon
her lackey general Inayat Latif and his Bengal <i>mansabdars </i>to Agra. And
declare Allaudin the next Moghul.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Jadar was stunned. Allaudin was incapable of anything, except
bowing to the queen's orders like a hand puppet. Once Moghul, he certainly
could not rule. She would rule for him. Or probably eliminate him entirely
after a few months.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>So Janahara had finally made her move. To challenge Prince
Jadar, the son who had earned the throne, for his rightful place. The battle
had been joined.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;So what do you propose to do? She waited just long
enough to trap you in the Deccan.&quot; Mumtaz's fury was turning to despair.
&quot;If you go back now, you'll be accused of abandoning Burhanpur. If you
march on south, you'll be unable to return for months. And by that time
Allaudin will be married. Father said she has convinced the Moghul to give him
a personal mansab rank of eight thousand <i>zat </i>and a horse rank of four
thousand <i>suwar</i>. Allaudin, who scarcely knows a bow from a wine bowl,
will now have his own cavalry.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Jadar was looking at her, but he no longer heard.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>This changes everything. There'll be no silver. The queen
will see to that.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>And no silver means no troops can be recalled from the Deccan
<i>mansabdars</i>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Which means we lose the Deccan. But she'd gladly give the</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Deccan to
destroy me.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Jadar looked at Mumtaz and smiled. &quot;Yes, I must do
something. But right now I'll see my <i>chitahs </i>fed.&quot; And he turned
and strode briskly back toward his tent.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>A dense mantle of evening smoke enveloped the camp as the
three generals passed through the entry of the gulal bar. They advanced to the
front of the sarachah platform and halted to wait for Jadar. Each had brought a
silver cup, as Jadar had instructed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>All three were seasoned military leaders. Abdullah Khan, a
young Moghul warrior, had been promoted to a rank of three thousand <i>suwar </i>after
the successful siege at the northern fortress of Kangra. Under the prince he
had risen from the rank of foot soldier to cavalry, and now he commanded his
own division. The next was Abul Hasan, a cool-headed Afghan strategist with
rank of five thousand <i>suwar</i>, who had led Prince Jadar to his first
victory in the Deccan three years before. Finally there was Raja Vikrama-jit, a
bearded Rajput of royal blood, who led the Hindus. He scorned matchlocks and
fought only with his sword, and he was the bravest man in battle that Jadar had
ever known.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Moments later Prince Jadar emerged through the smoke,
carrying his heavy sword and accompanied by Vasant Rao. A servant trailed after
them bearing a crystal decanter of wine and two silver goblets on a tray.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The prince assumed his seat in the center of the platform and
ordered the servant to place the decanter on a small table by his side. Then he
motioned away the servant and all the surrounding guards.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I propose we all take a glass of wine to clear our
thoughts. It's Persian, and I had it cooled in the saltpeter tent especially
for this evening.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Jadar personally poured wine for each of the men, then filled
the two goblets on the tray for Vasant Rao and for himself.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I hereby propose a toast to Ahmadnagar, which Malik
Ambar now calls his own capital. And to its recapture within a hundred
days.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The men raised their goblets and drank in silence. Skepticism
filled their eyes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Jadar looked at them and smiled. &quot;You do not agree? Then
let me tell you more. The situation is very bad. How bad even you do not yet
know. But battles are more than a matter of numbers. They are a test of the
will to win. That's why I called you here tonight.&quot; Jadar paused.
&quot;But first, is the wine to your liking?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The men nodded silent assent.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Good. Drink deeply, for none of us will drink again
until we drink in Ahmadnagar. Now I will take your cups.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Jadar reached for each man's cup individually and placed them
in a row alongside the tray, together with his own and that of Vasant Rao. Then
he laid his own cup on its side on the tray and slowly drew his heavy sword
from its scabbard. With a fierce swing he sliced the cup in half. Then the next
cup, and the next, until all were destroyed. The men watched him spellbound.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Assemble your ranks in the bazaar at midnight. In full
battle dress. I will address them. And at dawn, we march.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Jadar rose and as quickly as he had come disappeared into the
darkness.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Battle gear—helmets, buckles, pikes, swords, muskets—
glistened in the torchlight as Jadar rode a fully armored war elephant slowly
down the center of the main bazaar. The bristling infantry, arrayed in rows on
either side, watched him expectantly. A midnight muster was unheard of. But
rumors had already swept the camp telling of the pending marriage of the
queen's daughter to Allaudin. All knew Jadar had been betrayed. And with him,
all of them as well.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then they noticed carts following him, with barrels of wine
from Jadar's tent. When the prince reached the center of the bazaar, he raised
his arms for silence.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>For a moment all that could be heard was the neigh of horses
from the stables, and the cries of infants in the far reaches of the camp.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He began in Urdu, a hybrid camp tongue of Persian and</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Hindi, his
voice ringing toward Abul Hassan's Muslim troops.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>&quot;Tonight
we are many.&quot; Jadar paused deliberately. &quot;But in battle the many are
nothing. In battle there is only the one. Each of you is that one.&quot; Again
a pause. Then he shouted in a voice that carried to the far hills. &quot;Is
there a Believer among us tonight who would fight to the death for our
victory?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>        A
roar of assent sounded from the men.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>       
&quot;Will you swear it? On the Holy Quran?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>        This
time the roar shook the tent poles of the bazaar.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>       
&quot;Is there one who would not?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>       
Silence.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>       
Suddenly Jadar turned to the troops of Moghul lineage and switched his language
to exquisite Persian.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>       
&quot;Some here tonight swear to embrace death itself for our victory. But I
know not the will of all. Is there among you a man who would give his life for
us?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>       
Again a roar of assent.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>       
&quot;What man will swear it?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>         The
roar seemed to envelop the camp.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>        
Without pausing, Jadar turned to the Rajput contingent, addressing them easily
in their native Rajasthani.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>        
&quot;Does any among you know how to fight?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>        
Cheers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>        
&quot;Does any know how to die?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>         
More cheers. And then the Rajputs began banging their swords on their bucklers.
Jadar bellowed above the sudden dim.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>        
&quot;I know Hindus cannot take an oath. But if you could, would it be to fight
to the death for our victory?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>        
Bedlam seized the camp. And the chant &quot;Jadar-o-Akbar,&quot; Jadar is
Great, swept through the ranks. Jadar let the chant continue for a time, and as
he listened, he saw that Mumtaz and her women had appeared at the gateway of
the gulal bar, as he had instructed them. All activity had ceased in the camp,
and even in the far background the women had gathered in the shadows of the
tents, listening intently. Then Jadar motioned for silence and continued.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Tonight we each will make a pledge. I to you. You to
me. First my pledge to you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Jadar commanded his elephant to kneel, and he dismounted and
walked directly to the waiting wagons containing his wine barrels. He was
handed a silver-handled battle axe, and with a powerful overhand swing he
shattered the first barrel. Then he signaled his waiting guard, and in moments
every barrel had been axed. The center of the bazaar ran red, and the air was
filled with the wine's sweet Persian perfume.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then he motioned toward the entry of the <i>gulal bar </i>and
his women emerged, followed by an elephant whose <i>howdah</i>, the livery on
its back, was filled with silver utensils. When the procession reached the
clearing where Jadar stood, the elephant's mahout commanded it to kneel.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Without a word Jadar walked directly to the <i>howdah</i>. As
though meeting an enemy in ambush, he suddenly drew his long sword and swung it
through the livery, leaving a wide gash in its embroidered side. A glittering
array of silver and gold plate, goblets, jewelry poured onto the ground. With a
single motion he sheathed the sword and again took the axe.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>While the assembled camp watched spellbound, he quickly,
methodically, smashed each of the silver and gold objects into small shreds.
Then he broke the silver handle of the axe and again mounted the elephant.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;My pledge to you.&quot; His voice pierced the stunned
silence of the camp as he repeated each sentence in three languages. &quot;My
pledge to you is not to touch wine, not to lie with women, not to look on
silver or gold until we have taken Ahmadnagar.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The camp seemed to come apart with the cheer that followed,
and again came the chant &quot;Jadar-o-Akbar,&quot; &quot;Jadar-o-Akbar.&quot;
The sound was as one voice, and now even the distant hills echoed back the
sound. Again Jadar stopped them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Your pledge to me must be the same. And together we
will take Ahmadnagar in a hundred days. By the head of the Prophet I swear it
to you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Again the chant. And again Jadar stopped them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Tonight I offer to fight for you. You must be ready to
fight for me. And each must hold the other to his pledge.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>More cheers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I have spilled my wine. I will stay apart from my
women. I have smashed my gold and silver. I will give it to you. Each tent will
have a shard. But my eyes must never see it again.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The roar of approval was deafening.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That is my pledge. You must also give me yours. Leave
your women in their tents and lie beside me under the stars. Empty your wine
flasks into the Narbada River as we cross. As your oath to fight to the death.
And all your silver, that of your vessels, that on your saddles, that on your
women, must be brought here tonight. Mark it with your seal, and leave it under
guard in my own wagons, away from all eyes, until the day we reach Ahmadnagar.
Then we will drink wine, we will have women, we will wear our finest in
victory.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Jadar paused dramatically. &quot;Tonight we are many.
Tomorrow we are one. We march at sunrise!&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The cheers began again, and immediately the pile of silver
started to grow. Muslim nobles began bringing silver-trimmed saddles, plates,
even jewelry. But the most silver came from the Hindu infantry, as their women
were stripped of the silver bracelets and massive silver anklets that had been
their dowries.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Jadar sat unmoving on his elephant as the men began to come
forward with items of silver. Soon there was a line stretching into the dark of
the tents. He watched the pile growing, and his calculations began.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Will it be enough? The weight must be enough or the
Shahbandar, motherless thief that he is, will never agree. But I think we will
have it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He thought back over the plan. It had required almost the
entire afternoon to refine. But when he had convinced himself that it would
succeed, he had posted the pigeons to Surat.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Where, he had asked himself, can I find fifty lakhs of
silver, five million rupees, within a month, and have them at Burhanpur when we
arrive? I'll not squeeze a copper <i>pice</i>, penny, from Agra.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>If not Agra, where?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>And slowly in his mind a form had taken shape. He had</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>examined it,
almost touched it, puzzled over it. And then he knew what it was.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The mint at Surat. Where foreign coin is melted and recast as
rupees. Fifty lakhs of silver rupees would scarcely be missed. Especially if
the Shahbandar would allow his minters to work a normal day. The backlog of
foreign coin he holds unmelted, creating an artificial shortage of silver,
would easily cover fifty lakhs of rupees. I need only borrow what I need, and
with it buy back into service the cavalry I need to reclaim the Deccan.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The Shahbandar.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But will he do it?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He will. If I can show him collateral.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I don't have enough collateral. Not in my own funds. Not even
in the local treasuries.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But there must be enough silver in eighteen thousand tents to
assemble five million rupees.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I will hold it, and give him a note of obligation using it as
collateral. If we reach Ahmadnagar, I will squeeze the five million rupees many
times over from every traitorous <i>mansabdar </i>I do not hang. I will
confiscate their <i>jagir</i> estates and let them buy them back. I can easily
confiscate enough to return the Shahbandar his loan, and then my men will have
back their silver.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>If we do not reach Ahmadnagar, it will be because we are
dead. So what will it matter? We will make an oath to reach the city or die.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Only one problem remains.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>How to move the coin from Surat to Burhanpur. Secretly. No
one must know where it came from or that it's being transferred. But a train
with fifty lakhs of rupees must be heavily guarded. And the guards will betray
its value.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Unless there can be some other reason for a heavily guarded
train from Surat to Burhanpur. A reason that would not automatically evoke
suspicion. Possibly a person of importance. Someone whom all India knows cannot
be touched. Someone important to the Moghul.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>And then the perfect answer came. The most obvious answer of
all. Who will soon be traveling from Surat to Burhanpur, en route to Agra,
under safe conduct of the Moghul? The Englishman.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The infidel <i>feringhi </i>need never know. That with him
will be the silver that will save Prince Jadar.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>        
Brian Hawksworth stepped lightly off the prow of the barge as it eased into the
riverbank and worked his way through the knee-deep tidal mud onto the sandy
shore. Even here, across the harbor, the water still stank of the sewers of
Surat. Then he turned and surveyed the sprawling city, back across the broad
estuary, astonished that they could have crossed the harbor so easily on
nothing more substantial than a wide raft of boards lashed with rope, what the
Indians called a bark.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Ahead, waiting on the shore, was a line of loaded bullock
carts—conveyances with two wooden wheels higher than a man's head, a flat bed
some six feet wide, and a heavy bamboo pole for a tongue—each yoked to two
tall, humpbacked gray cattle with conspicuous ribs. The carts stretched down
the muddy road that emerged from the tangle of coastal scrub and were piled to
overflowing with rolls of English wool cloth. The turbaned drivers now shouted
Hindi obscenities as they walked alongside and lashed the sullen cattle into
place for unloading. As Hawksworth watched, the porters who had ridden with him
splashed their way toward the shore and began driving stakes to secure the
mooring lines of the bark. Wool would be ferried across the harbor and cotton
brought back with each trip.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then Hawksworth caught sight of George Elkington's ragged hat
bobbing in the midday sunshine as the Chief Merchant and his aide, Humphrey
Spencer, climbed down from their two-wheeled Indian coach, drawn by two white
oxen, which had been loaned by Shahbandar. Farther down the line of carts was a
detail of English seamen, led by red-haired Mackintosh, and all carrying
muskets, who had walked the fifteen-mile, two-day trek to guard the cargo.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The trading season was well underway, and over the past three
weeks a motley assemblage of cargo vessels from the length of the Indian Ocean
had appeared downriver at the bar to commence unlading. Foreign traders
normally transported goods inland to Surat on the barks that plied the Tapti
between the port and the shallow bar at the river mouth. But these vessels had
arrived at the bar with the blessings of Portugal, for they all had acquired a
Portuguese license and paid duty on their cargo at some Portuguese-controlled
tax point.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>After evaluating the risk of exposing his English frigates at
the bar—where maneuverability was limited and the possibility of Portuguese
surprise great—Brian Hawksworth had elected to unlade directly onshore from
their protected anchorage north of the river mouth, the cove called Swalley,
then haul the goods overland to the banks of the Tapti opposite Surat. There
would be no risk of Portuguese interference inland and, once across from the
port, the goods could be easily barged to the <i>maidan</i>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>He turned again toward the river and examined the
town of Surat from his new vantage. It was easy to see now why this location
had been chosen for the port, for here the river curved and widened, creating a
natural, protected harbor. The most conspicuous landmarks visible from across
the harbor were three stone villas along the riverfront, all owned by the
Shahbandar, and the square stone fort that stood on the downriver side of the
harbor, its heavy ordnance trained perpetually on the water. The fort was
surrounded by a moat on three sides and on the fourth by the river. Entry could
only be gained through a gate on the riverside, or a drawbridge that connected
its entrance to the open <i>maidan</i>, the square where traders congregated.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The square had swarmed with merchants and brokers as they
passed through, and he had watched as two brokers stood together near its
center—one from Ahmedabad, up-country, and the other from Surat—arguing loudly
over the price and quality of a pile of indigo. The porters explained that the
Surat broker was accusing the other of mixing sand with the indigo to increase
its weight, then disguising his deception by also adding enough oil that the
indigo would still float on water, the test used to establish purity of the
dried extract of the indigo leaf. As the argument grew more vigorous,
Hawksworth noticed the men join hands beneath a piece of cloth, where they
began negotiating the actual price by means of their fingers, a figure
undoubtedly little related to the movement of their tongues.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Now that the high trading season of September-January had
begun, Surat's narrow streets were one loud bazaar, swollen to almost two
hundred thousand grasping traders, bargaining seamen, hawking merchants. A
dozen languages stirred the air as a motley mélange of up-country Indian
traders, Arabs, Jains, Parsis, Persians, Jews, Egyptians, Portuguese, and
returning Muslim pilgrims—every nationality known to the Indian Ocean—swaggered
through the garbage-sodden mud paths called streets.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth gazed back at the city and reflected over the
curious events of the past three weeks. The English had, inexplicably, been
received first with open hostility, and then with suspiciously cordial
deference—first by the governor, and afterward by the Shahbandar. Something is
very wrong, he told himself. A contest of wills is underway between the
Shahbandar, Mirza Nuruddin, and the governor, Mukarrab Khan. And so far, Mukarrab
Khan seems to be winning. Or is he?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Six days before, the governor had suddenly reversed his
policy of noninterference in port affairs and authorized a license for the
English to sell their cargo in Surat and buy Indian goods, something the
Shahbandar had found one excuse after another to delay. However, Mukarrab Khan
had delivered this license directly to the English, rather than forwarding it
to the Shahbandar through normal channels, leaving Brian Hawksworth the
unpleasant responsibility of presenting this document to the Shahbandar in
person. But the meeting turned out to be nothing like Hawksworth had expected.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Once more you astound me, Captain.&quot; The close,
torch-lit chamber of the customs house office had fallen expectantly silent as
the Shahbandar drew slowly on his hookah and squinted with his opaque, glassy
eyes at the black seal of Mukarrab Khan affixed to the top of the page.
Hawksworth had waited for a glimmer of anger at this insulting breach of port
protocol—which surely was Mukarrab Khan's reason for insisting the license be
delivered by the English Captain-General. But the Shahbandar's eyes never lost
their noncommittal squint. Instead he had turned to Hawksworth with a cordial
smile. &quot;Your refusal to negotiate seems to have worked remarkable dispatch
with His Excellency's officials. I can't recall ever seeing them act this
quickly.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth had been amazed. How could Mirza Nuruddin possibly
know the terms he had demanded of the governor: produce a license for trade
within ten days or the two English frigates would weigh anchor and sail; and
accept English sovereigns at bullion value rather than the prevailing discount
rate of 4 1/2 percent required to circumvent &quot;minting time,&quot; the
weeks &quot;required&quot; by the Shahbandar's minters to melt down foreign
coin and re-mint it as Indian rupees.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>No one could have been more surprised than Brian Hawksworth
when Mukarrab Khan had immediately conceded the English terms and approved the
license—valid for sixty days—to land goods, and to buy and sell. Why had the
governor agreed so readily, overriding the Shahbandar's dawdling clerks?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Naturally you'll need an officer here to schedule the
river barks.&quot; The Shahbandar's voice was even, but Hawksworth thought he
sensed an air of tension suddenly grip the room. &quot;Normally barks are
reserved weeks in advance now during the high season, but we can always
accommodate friends of Mukarrab Khan.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It was then that Hawksworth had told the Shahbandar he would
not be bringing cargo up the river, that instead it would be transported
overland from their protected anchorage using bullock carts arranged for by
Mukarrab Khan.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The cove you call Swalley is several leagues up the
coast, Captain. Foreign cargo has never before been unladed there, nor has it
ever been brought overland as you propose.&quot; He had seemed genuinely
disturbed. &quot;I suggest it's both irregular and unworkable.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I think you understand why we have to unlade from the
cove. The decision is made.&quot; Hawksworth tried to keep his voice as firm as
that of Mirza Nuruddin. &quot;We'll unload the bullock carts just across the
river from the port here, and we'll only need a bark to ferry goods across the
harbor.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;As you wish. I'll arrange to have one at your
disposal.&quot; The Shahbandar drew pensively on the hookah, ejecting coils of
smoke into the already dense air of the chamber, and examined Hawksworth. Then
he continued. &quot;I understand your frigates are some five hundred tons each.
Full unlading will require at least three weeks, perhaps four. Is that a
reasonable estimate?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We'll arrange the scheduling. Why do you ask?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Merely for information, Captain.&quot; Again the
Shahbandar flashed his empty smile. Then he bowed as lightly as protocol would
admit and called for a tray of rolled betel leaves, signifying the meeting was
ended. As Hawksworth took one, he marveled that he had so quickly acquired a
taste for their strange alkaline sweetness. Then he looked again at Mirza
Nuruddin's impassive eyes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Damn him. Does he know what the Portugals were planning? And
was he hoping we'd be caught unlading in the shallows at the river mouth? He
knows I've just spoiled their plans.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As he had passed back through the customs shed headed toward
the <i>maidan</i> and sunshine, Hawksworth could feel the hostile stares. And
he knew the reason.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The new English visitors had already made an unforgettable
impression on the town of Surat. The merchants George Elkington and Humphrey
Spencer had been given accommodations by a Portuguese-speaking Muslim, whom
Spencer had immediately outraged by demanding they be served pork. The other
men had been temporarily lodged in a vacant house owned by an indigo broker.
After the hard-drinking English seamen had disrupted orderly proceedings in
three separate brothels, and been banned in turn by each, the Shahbandar had
ordered five <i>nautch</i> girls sent to them at the house. But with fewer
women than men, a fight inevitably had ensued, with thorough demolition of the
plaster walls and shutters.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Worst of all, bosun's mate John Garway had gone on a drunken
spree in the streets and, in a flourish of exuberance, severed the tail of a
bullock calf—an animal sacred to the Hindus—with his seaman's knife. A riot in
the Hindu quarter had erupted soon after, forcing Mukarrab Khan to remove the
English seamen outside the town walls, in tents erected by the
&quot;tank,&quot; the city reservoir.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Yes, Hawksworth sighed, it'll be a long time before India
forgets her first taste of the English.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The barge bobbed lightly as two Indian porters, knee-deep in
the mud, hoisted the first roll of woolen cloth onto the planking. This begins
the final leg of the India voyage, Hawksworth thought to himself. And this has
been the easiest part of all.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Almost too easy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Pox on it, believe in your luck for a change. The voyage will
post a fortune in pepper. Lancaster was knighted for little more than bringing
home his vessels. He reached Java, but he found no trade. He'd have sailed home
a pauper if he hadn't ambushed a rich Portuguese galleon in the harbor at
Sumatra.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>How many weeks to a knighthood? Three? Four? No, we'll make it
in less. We'll man every watch. Woolens aland, cotton out. I'll have the
frigates laded, stores on board—we can buy cattle and sheep from villages up
the coast—and all repairs completed in two weeks. I'll have both frigates in
open seas inside a fortnight, where not a Portugal bottom afloat can touch us.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>And if permission for the trip to Agra comes, I'll be out of
Surat too.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>If I live that long.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He reached into his belt and drew out a long Portuguese
stiletto. An elaborate cross was etched into the blade, and</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>the handle
was silver, with a ram's head at the butt. The ram's eyes were two small
rubies. He had been carrying it for two days, and he reflected again on what
had happened, still puzzling.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He had returned to the observatory the next morning after he
had met Shirin, and this time he brought his lute. But she did not come. That
morning, or the morning after, or the morning after. Finally he swallowed his
disappointment and concluded he would not see her again. Then it was he had
gone to work cleaning away the moss and accumulated mud from the stone
instruments. Parts of some seemed to be missing, and he had searched the hut
for these without success. All he had found was a hand-held astrolabe, an
instrument used to take the altitude of the sun. But he also found tables,
piles of handwritten tables, that seemed to hold the key to the use of the
instruments. His hopes had soared. It seemed possible, just possible, that
buried somewhere in the hut was the key to the greatest mystery of all time—how
to determine longitude at sea.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth had often pondered the difficulties of navigation
in the deep ocean, where only the sun and stars were guides. They were the
primary determent to England's new ambition to explore the globe, for English
navigators were still far less experienced than those of the Spanish and
Portuguese.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The problem seemed overwhelming. Since the great earth was
curved, no line on its surface was straight, and once at sea there was
absolutely no way to determine exactly where you were, which way you were
going, or how fast.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The least uncertain measurement was probably latitude, a
ship's location north or south of the equator. In the northern hemisphere the
height of the polestar was a reasonably accurate determinant of latitude,
although it was a full three degrees distant from the northernmost point in the
sky. Another measure of latitude was the height of the sun at midday, corrected
for the specific day of the year. The problem lay in how to measure either of
these elevations accurately.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>A hundred years before, the Portuguese had come across an
ingenious Arab device for telling the elevation of the sun. It consisted of a
board with a knotted length of string run through the middle. If a mariner held
the board vertically and sighted the horizon at one end and some object in the
sky at the other, the length of the string between the board and his eye could
be used to calculate the elevation of the object. In a short time a version
appeared in Europe—with a second board replacing the string—called the
cross-staff.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>However, since locating both the horizon and a star was
almost impossible at any time except dawn or dusk, this device worked best for
sighting the sun—save that it required staring into the disc of the sun to find
its exact center. Also, the cross-staff could not be used when the sun was high
in the sky, which was the case in equatorial waters. Another version of the
cross-staff was the astrolabe, a round brass dial etched with degree markings
and provided with a movable sight that permitted taking the elevation of the
sun by its shadow. But even with the astrolabe there was the problem of
catching the sun precisely at midday. And on a rolling ship the error in
reading it could easily be four degrees.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>For longitude, a ship's location east or west on the globe,
there were no fixed references at all; but as a mariner traveled east or west,
the sun would come up somewhat earlier or later each day, and precisely how
much earlier or later could be used to compute how far he had gone. Therefore,
calculating longitude depended solely on keeping time extremely
accurately—something completely impossible. The best timekeeping device
available was the hourglass or &quot;sandglass,&quot; invented somewhere in the
western Mediterranean in the eleventh or twelfth century. Sandglass makers
never achieved real accuracy or consistency, and careful mariners always used
several at once, hoping to average out variations. But on a long voyage seamen
soon totally lost track of absolute time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Since they were unable to determine a ship's location from
the skies, mariners also tried to compute it from a vessel's speed and
direction. Speed was estimated by throwing a log</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>with a
knotted rope attached overboard and timing the rate at which the knots in the
rope played out—using a sandglass. Margins of error in computing speed were
usually substantial. Direction, too, was never known completely accurately. A
compass pointed to magnetic north, not true north, and the difference between
these seemed to vary unaccountably at different locations on the globe. Some
thought it had to do with the lodestone used to magnetize the needle, and
others, like the Grand Pilot of the king of Spain, maintained seamen were
merely lying to cover their own errors.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>For it all, however, longitude was the most vital unknown.
Many attempts had been made to find a way to fix longitude, but nothing ever
worked. Seamen found the only real solution to the problem was &quot;latitude
sailing,&quot; a time-consuming and expensive procedure whereby a captain would
sail north or south to the approximate latitude of his destination and then
sail due east or west, rather than trying to sail on the diagonal. King Philip
III of Spain had offered a fortune to the first man who discovered how to tell
longitude at sea.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth spent days poring through the piles of tables,
many of which were strewn about the floor of the room and damaged from mildew
and rot. Next he carefully copied the symbols off the walls of the circular
building and matched these with those on several of the charts. Were these the
names of the major stars, or constellations of the zodiac, or . . . what? The
number was twenty-eight.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>And then it came to him: they were the daily stations of the
moon.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As he continued to sift through the documents, he realized
that the scholar who wrote them had predicted eclipses of the moon for many
years in advance. Then he found a book, obviously old, with charts that seemed
to provide geometric corrections for the distortion caused by the atmosphere
when sighting stars near the horizon, something that always had been
troublesome for navigators.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He also found other writings. New. Some appeared to be
verses, and others, tables of names and numbers. Sums of</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>money were
written next to some of the names. But none of it meant anything without the
Persian, which he could not read. And Shirin had never returned to the
observatory, at least not when he was there.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Until two days ago.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>At the observatory that morning the sky had been a perfect
ice blue, the garden and orchard still, the air dry and exhilarating. No
workmen were splashing in the moat beyond the wall that day. Only the buzz of
gnats intruded on the silence. He had brought a bottle of dry Persian wine to
make the work go faster, finding he was growing accustomed to its taste. And he
had brought his lute, as always, in hope Shirin would come again.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He was in the stone hut, cleaning and sorting pages of
manuscript, when she appeared silently in the doorway. He looked up and felt a
sudden rush in his chest.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Have you uncovered all of Jamshid Beg's secrets?&quot;
Her voice was lilting, but with a trace of unease. &quot;I've found out that
was our famous astronomer's name. He was originally from Samarkand.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I think I'm beginning to understand some of the
tables.&quot; Hawksworth kept his tone matter-of-fact. &quot;He should have
been a navigator. He could have been a fellow at Trinity House.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What is that?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It's a guild in England. Where navigators are
trained.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She laughed. &quot;I think he preferred a world made only of
numbers.&quot; Her laugh was gone as quickly as it had come, and she moved
toward him with a vaguely troubled look. &quot;What have you found?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;A lot of things. Take a look at this drawing.&quot;
Hawksworth tried to remain nonchalant as he moved the lamp back to the table
from where he had placed it on the floor. &quot;He identified what we call
parallax, the slight circular motion of the moon throughout the day caused by
the fact it's not sighted from the center of the earth, but from a spot on its
surface that moves as the earth rotates. Now if he could measure that
accurately enough with these instruments . . .&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Shirin waved her hand and laughed again. &quot;If you</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>understand
all this, why not just take the papers back to the palace and work with them
there?&quot; She was in the room now, her olive cheeks exquisitely shadowed by
the partially open door, where flickering shadows played lightly through the
brilliant sunshine. &quot;Today I'd rather hear you play your English
instrument.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;With pleasure. I've been trying to learn an Indian
raga.&quot; He kept his voice even and moved himself deftly between Shirin and
the doorway, blocking her exit. &quot;But it sounds wrong on the lute. When I
get to Agra I'm thinking I'll have a sitar made . . .&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He reached as though for the lute, then swung his hand upward
and clapped it over Shirin's mouth. Before she could move he shoved her against
the wall beside the door and stretched with his other hand to seize the heavy
brass astrolabe that rested on a stand by the table. He caught a look of pure
terror in her eyes, and for a moment he thought she might scream. He pressed
her harder against the wall to seal her mouth, and as the shaft of light from
the doorway dimmed momentarily he stepped forward and swung the brass astrolabe
upward.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>There was a soft sound of impact, followed by a choked groan
and the clatter of metal against the wooden door. He drew back the astrolabe,
now with a trace of blood along its sharp edge and the remains of a tooth
wedged between its discs. Then he looked out to see a dark-skinned Indian man
in a loincloth rolling himself across the top of the garden wall. A faint
splash followed, as he dropped into the moat.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>When Hawksworth released Shirin and placed the astrolabe back
on its stand, he caught the glint of sunshine off a stiletto lying in the
doorway. He bent down to retrieve it and suddenly she was next to him, holding
his arm and staring at the place where the man had scaled the wall.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;He was a Sudra, a low caste.&quot; She looked at the
stiletto in Hawksworth's hand, and her voice turned to scorn. &quot;It's
Portuguese. Only the Portuguese would hire someone like that, instead of a
Rajput.&quot; Then she laughed nervously. &quot;If they'd hired a Rajput,
someone would be dead now. Hire a Sudra and you get a Sudra's work.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Who was it?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Who knows? The horse bazaar is full of men who would kill
for ten rupees.&quot; She pointed toward the wall. &quot;Do you see that piece
of cloth? There on the old spike. I think it's a piece of his <i>dhoti</i>.
Would you get it for me?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>After Hawksworth had retrieved the shred of cotton
loincloth, brown from a hundred washings in the river, she had taken it from
him without a word.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What will you do with it?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Don't.&quot; She touched a finger to his lips.
&quot;These are things it's best not to ask.&quot; Then she tucked the brown
scrap into the silken sash at her waist and moved toward the door. &quot;And it
would be better if you forgot about today.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth watched her for a second, then seized her arm and
turned her facing him. &quot;I may not know what's going on. But, by Jesus,
I'll know before you leave. And you can start by telling me why you come
here.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She stared back at him for a moment, meeting his eyes. There
was something in them he had never seen before, almost admiration. Then she
caught herself and drew back, dropping into a chair. &quot;Very well. Perhaps
you do deserve to know.&quot; She slipped the translucent scarf from her hair
and tossed it across the table. &quot;Why don't you open the wine you brought?
I'll not tell you everything, because you shouldn't want me to, but I'll tell
you what's important for you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth remembered how he had slowly poured the wine for
her, his hand still trembling.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Have you ever heard of Samad?&quot; she had begun,
taking a small sip.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I think he's the poet Mukarrab Khan quoted once. He
called him a Sufi rascal.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Is that what he said? Good. That only confirms once
again what I think of His Excellency.&quot; She laughed with contempt.
&quot;Samad is a great poet. He's perhaps the last great Persian writer, in the
tradition of Omar Khayyam. He has favored me by allowing me to be one of his
disciples.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;So you come here to write poems?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;When I feel something I want to say.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But I've also found lists of names here, and
numbers.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I told you I can't tell you everything.&quot; Shirin's
look darkened momentarily as she drank again lightly from the cup, then settled
it on the table. He found himself watching her face, drawn to her by something
he could not fully understand. &quot;But I can tell you this. There's someone
in India who will one day rid us of the infidel Portuguese. Do you know of
Prince Jadar?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;He's the son of the Moghul. I'm guessing he'll probably
succeed one day.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;He should. If he's not betrayed. Things are very
unsettled in Agra. He has many enemies there.&quot; She paused. &quot;He has
enemies here.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm not sure I understand.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then you should. Because what happens in Agra will
affect everyone. Even you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But what does Agra politics have to do with me? The
knife was Portuguese.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;To understand what's happening, you should first know
about Akman, the one we remember now as the Great Moghul. He was the father of
Arangbar, the Moghul now. I was only a small girl when Akman died, but I still
remember my sadness, my feeling the universe would collapse. We worshiped him
almost. It's not talked about now, but the truth is Akman didn't really want
Arangbar to succeed him, nobody did. But he had no choice. In fact, when Akman
died, Arangbar's eldest son started a rebellion to deny him the throne, but
that son's troops betrayed him, and after they surrendered Arangbar blinded him
in punishment. Khusrav, his own son. Although Prince Jadar was still only a
young boy then, we all thought after that he would be Moghul himself one day.
But that was before the Persians came to power in Agra.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But aren't you Persian yourself?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I was born in India, but yes, I have the great fortune
to be of Persian blood. There are many Persians in India. You know, Persians
still intimidate the Moghuls. Ours is a magnificent culture, an ancient
culture, and Persians never let the Moghuls forget it.&quot; Shirin had dabbed
at her brow and rose to peer out the door of the observatory building, as
though by instinct. &quot;Did you know that the first Moghul came to India less
than a hundred years ago, actually after the Portuguese? He was named Babur, a
distant descendant of the Mongol warrior Genghis Khan, and he was from Central
Asia. Babur was the grandfather of Akman. They say he had wanted to invade
Persia but that the ruling dynasty, the Safavis, was too strong. So he invaded
India instead, and the Moghuls have been trying to make it into Persia ever
since. That's why Persians can always find work in India. They teach their
language at court, and give lessons in fashion, and in painting and garden
design. Samad came here from Persia, and now he's the national poet.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What do these Persians have to do with whatever's happening
in Agra? Are you, or your family, somehow involved too?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;My father was Shayhk Mirak.&quot; She hesitated a
moment, as though expecting a response. Then she continued evenly, &quot;Of
course, you'd not know of him. He was a court painter. He came to India when
Akman was Moghul and took a position under the Persian Mir Sayyid Ali, who
directed the painting studio Akman founded. You know, I've always found it
amusing that Akman had to use Persian artists to create the Moghul school of
Indian painting. Anyway, my father was very skilled at Moghul portraits, which
everybody now says were invented by Akman. And when Akman died, Arangbar named
my father to head the school. It lasted until she was brought to Agra.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Who?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The queen, the one called Janahara.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But why was your father sent away?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Because I was sent away.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth thought he sensed a kind of nervous intensity
quivering behind Shirin's voice. It's your story, he told himself, that I'd
really like to hear. But he said nothing, and the silence swelled. Finally she
spoke again.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;To understand the trouble now, you must understand
about the queen. Her story is almost amazing, and already legends are growing
around her. It's said she was born the day her father, Zainul Beg, left Persia
as an adventurer bound for India. He ordered her abandoned in the sun to die,
but after the caravan traveled on his wife lamented for the baby so much he
decided to return for her. Although the sun was intense, they found her still
alive. It's said a cobra was shading her with his hood.&quot; Shirin turned to
Hawksworth, her dark eyes seeming to snap. &quot;Can you believe such a
story?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;No. It sounds like a fable.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Neither can I. But half the people in India do. Her
father finally reached Lahore, the city in India where Akman was staying, and
managed to enter his service. Like any Persian he did very well, and before
long Akman gave him a <i>mansab </i>rank of three hundred <i>zat</i>. His wife
and daughter were allowed to come and go among the palace women. Then, when she
was seventeen, this little Persian girl of the cobra began her plan. She
repeatedly threw herself across the path of the Moghul’s son Arangbar, whom she
rightly guessed would be next in line for the throne. He was no match for her,
and now people say she won his heart before he knew it himself. My own belief
is she cast a spell on him.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And he married her?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Of course not. Akman was no fool. He knew she was a
schemer, and when he saw what she was doing he immediately had her married to a
Persian general named Sher Afgan, whom he then appointed governor of Bengal, a
province in the distant east of India. Akman died a few years after that, still
thinking he had saved Arangbar from her, but he hadn't counted on the
spell.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;So how did she get back to Agra, and become
queen?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That part I know very well.&quot; Shirin laughed
bitterly. &quot;I was there. You see, Arangbar never forgot his Persian cobra
girl, even after he became Moghul himself. And he found a way to get her back.
One day he announced he was receiving reports of unrest in Bengal, where Sher
Afgan was still governor, and he summoned the governor to Agra to explain. When
no answer came, he sent troops. Nobody knows what happened, but the story was
given out that Sher Afgan drew a sword on Arangbar's men. Perhaps he did. They
say he was impulsive. But the Imperial troops cut him down. Then Arangbar
ordered Sher Afgan's Persian wife and her little daughter, Layla, back to Agra
and put them under the protection of his mother, the dowager queen. Then, just
as we'd all predicted, he married her. At first he was going to put her in the <i>zenana</i>,
the harem, but she refused. She demanded to be made his queen, an equal. And
that's what he did. Except now she's actually more. She's the real ruler of
India.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And you were in the harem, the <i>zenana</i>, then?&quot;
Hawksworth decided to gamble on the story he had heard.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Shirin stared at him, trying to hide what seemed to be
surprise. &quot;You know.&quot; For a moment he thought she might reach out and
touch his hand, but then she drew back into herself. &quot;Yes, I was still in
the <i>zenana</i> then, but not for long. The first thing Janahara did was find
out which women Arangbar favored, and she then had us all married off to
governors of provinces far from Agra. You know a Muslim man is allowed four
wives, so there's always room for one more. Mukarrab Khan got me.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;She seems very clever.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You haven't heard even half her story yet. Next she
arranged to have her brother, Nadir Sharif, appointed prime minister, and her
father, Zainul Beg, made chief adviser to Arangbar. So now she and her family
control the Moghul and everyone around him.&quot; Shirin paused. &quot;Not
quite everyone. Yet. Not Prince Jadar.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But he'll be the next Moghul. When that happens, what
becomes of her?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;He <i>should </i>be the next Moghul. And if he is, her
power will be gone. That's why she wants to destroy him now.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But how can she, if he's the rightful heir?&quot;
Hawksworth found himself suddenly dismayed by the specter of Agra in turmoil.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;No one knows. But she'll think of a way. And then
she'll find someone she can control to be the next Moghul.&quot;''</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>'But why do you care so much who succeeds Arangbar?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;One reason I care is because of Samad.&quot; Her eyes
suddenly saddened.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Now I really don't understand. He's a poet. Why should</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>it matter to
him?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Because the queen would like to see him dead. He has
too much influence. You must understand that the queen and her family are
Shi'ites, a Persian sect of Islam. They believe all men should bow to some
dogmatic mullah, whom they call an <i>imam</i>. But this was never in the
teachings given to the Prophet.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>A curse on all religions, Hawksworth had thought. Am I caught
in the middle of some Muslim holy war?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But why do these Persians, or their <i>imams</i>, want
to be rid of Samad?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Because he's a Sufi, a mystic, who teaches that we all
should find God within our own selves. Without the mullahs. That's why the
Persian Shi'ites despise him and want him dead.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then he's supporting Prince Jadar?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Samad does not concern himself with politics. But it's
the duty of the others of us, those who understand what is happening, to help
Prince Jadar. Because we know he will stop the Persians and their Shi'ites who
are now spreading their poison of hate in India, and he'll also rid India of
the Portuguese. I'm sure of it.&quot; She paused for a moment. &quot;You know,
it's always seemed ironic that the Persians and the Portuguese should actually
work together. But in a way each needs the other. The Portuguese have made the
Persians, particularly the queen and her brother, Nadir Sharif, very rich, and
in return they're allowed to send their Jesuits to preach. So both the Persians
and the Portuguese want to prevent Prince Jadar from becoming the next Moghul,
since they know he'd like nothing better than to rid India of them both.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But what does this have to do with me? I just want a
trading <i>firman</i> from Arangbar. He's still alive and healthy, and he
should know the Portugals can't stop English trading ships from coming here.
Why shouldn't he give us a <i>firman</i>?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Can't you see? The English can never be allowed to
trade here. It would be the beginning of the end for the Portuguese. It would
show all the world they no longer can control India's ports. But what I'm
really trying to make you see is that it's not only the Portuguese who want to
stop you. It's also the people who support them. So no one can aid you openly.
The Persians are already too powerful. Still, there are those here who would
protect you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Who do you mean?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;How could I possibly tell you?&quot; She held him with
her eyes. &quot;I scarcely know you. But you should listen to your intuition.
Samad says we all have an inner voice that tells us what is true.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>This time she did reach and touch his hand, and her touch was
strangely warm in the chill of the room. &quot;I can't tell you any more,
really. So now will you play for me? Something tender, perhaps. A song you
would play for the woman you left behind you in England.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I didn't have all that much to leave behind.&quot; He
picked up the lute. &quot;But I'll be happy to play for you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You have no one?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;There was a woman in London. But she married while I
was . . . gone.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;She wouldn't wait while you were away?&quot; Shirin
sipped again from her cup and her eyes darkened. &quot;That must have been very
sad for you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It could be she didn't think I was worth waiting
for.&quot; He hesitated. &quot;I've had some time to think about it since. In a
way it was probably my own fault. I think she wanted more than I was ready to
give.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She looked at him and smiled. &quot;Perhaps what she wanted
was you. And you wouldn't give yourself. Tell me what she was like.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What was she like?&quot; He looked away, remembering
Maggie's face with a strange mixture of longing and bitterness. &quot;Well,
she's like nobody I've seen in India. Red hair, blue eyes . . . and a salty
tongue.&quot; He laughed. &quot;If she was ever anybody's fourth wife, I'd pity
the other three.&quot; He felt his laugh fade. &quot;I missed her a lot when I
was away before. But now . . .&quot; He tried to shrug.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She looked at him as though she understood it all. &quot;Then
if you won't play for her any more, will you play just for me? One of your
English ragas?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What if I played a suite by Dowland, one of our English
composers? It's one of my favorites.&quot; He found himself smiling again, the
lute comfortable and reassuring in his grasp. &quot;I hope you won't think it
sounds too out of place.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We're both out of place here now.&quot; She returned
his smile wistfully and glanced at the papers on the desk. &quot;You and
me.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth saw George Elkington approaching and dropped the
dagger quickly into his boot.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;'Twill take a lifetime the rate these heathens
dawdle.&quot; Elkington wiped a sweaty arm across his brow. Deep bags sagged
under his bloodshot eyes. &quot;An' we'll be months movin' the lead and
ironwork with these damn'd rickety carts. Not to mention the silver bullion for
buyin' commodity. We'll have to get a barge.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;How many more trips do you need to bring in the
wool?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Can't say. But 'tis clear we'll need more of these
damn'd carts, for what little they're worth.&quot; As Elkington turned to spit,
he spotted a porter who had let a roll of woolen cloth dip into the river, and
his neck veins pulsed. &quot;Hey, you heathen bastard, mind the water!&quot; He
stumbled after the terrified man trailing a stream of oaths.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth leaned against the wooden spokes of a bullock cart
and quickly passed the stiletto from his boot back to his belt. As he watched,
the bark tipped, beginning to list dangerously, and then he heard Elkington
command the porters to stop the loading and prepare to get underway. Only five
of the twenty-five bullock carts had been emptied, and the sun was already
approaching midafternoon. As Hawksworth had watched the men at work, some
corner of his mind had become dimly aware of a curious anomaly. Whereas the
Shahbandar's porters were working at full speed, the drivers of the bullock
carts seemed actually to be hindering the unloading—moving the carts around in
a confused way that always kept the work disorganized. And a number of answers
began, just began, to fall into place.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Captain-General Hawksworth, do you expect to be joinin'
us?&quot; George Elkington stalked up and began to scrape his muddy boots on
the spokes of the bullock cart</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Elkington, I want you to dismiss these drivers.&quot;
Hawksworth ignored his sarcastic tone. &quot;I want the Shahbandar to supply
all our men from now on.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What the bloody hell for?&quot; Elkington tightened his
hat and hitched up his belt.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Something's wrong. Did you have any accidents coming in
from Swalley?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Accidents? Nay, not a bleedin' one. Unless you'd call
the axle of a cart breakin' the first day and blockin' a narrow turn in the
road, with mud on both sides so we couldn't pass and had to unload the whole
bleedin' lot and look half the mornin' for another cart to hire. An' then the
drivers had a fight over who was responsible, and who'd pay for what, and we
couldn't start till after midday. And yesterday one of their damn'd bullocks
died, right in the road. Which is scarce wonder, considerin' how worn out they
are. Nay, we had no accidents. The whole bleedin' trip was an accident.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then let's get rid of them all. Men, carts, bullocks,
the lot. And hire new. Let the Shahbandar hire them for us. We pay in silver,
and give him his commission, and I'm sure he'll provide us what we need.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Think he can do any better?&quot; Elkington's skeptical
eyes squinted against the sun. &quot;These damn'd heathens all appear similar.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I think he'll make a difference. They all seem
terrified of him. We have to try.&quot; Hawksworth started for the barge.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You don't have much time left.&quot; Shirin had said.
&quot;Try to understand what's happening.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The porters were loosening the lines on the pegs. The bark
was ready to get underway.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Don't assume you know who'll aid you,&quot; she had
said. &quot;Help may come in a way that surprises you. It can't be known who's
helping you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He waded through the mud and pulled himself onto the</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>bark. Then
he turned and rolled over onto a bale of cloth. The sky was flawless and empty.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Just trust what feels right,&quot; she had said, and
for no reason at all she had reached out and touched his lute. &quot;Learn to
trust your senses. Most of all&quot;—she had taken his hand and held it longer
than she should have—&quot;learn to open yourself.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>They were underway.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The Shahbandar watched from the <i>maidan</i> as the bark of
English woolens moved in short spurts toward the steps below him. Oars sparkled
in the sunshine, and the faint chant of the rowers bounced, garbled, across the
waves. Behind him two short, surly-eyed men held the large umbrella that shaded
his face and rotund belly. A circle of guards with poles pushed away traders
who shouted begs and bribes for a moment of his time injtheir tent, to inspect
their goods please and render them salable commodity with his chapp and an
invoice stating their worth, preferably undervalued. The 2 1/2 percent duty was
prescribed by the Moghul. The assessed value was not.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Mirza Nuruddin ignored them. He was calculating time, not
rupees.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>His latest report was that four weeks more were needed for
the Viceroy to outfit the galleons and fireships. But the single-masted
frigatta bringing the news from Goa was two weeks in travel. Which means the
galleons will be here within three, perhaps two weeks, he told himself. A
Portuguese armada of twelve warships. The Englishman's luck has run out.
They'll be caught unlading and burned.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He fingered the shred of dirty cloth tucked in his waist. It
had been sent by Shirin, wrapped with a gift of aga of the rose. Her cryptic
note had told him all he had needed to know. When his spies reported no one
recently injured among the servants of the Portuguese Jesuits, the search had
begun in the horse bazaar. They had found the man the next day. The truth had
come quickly when Mirza Nuruddin's name was mentioned.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>And nothing had been learned. The man had been given the
knife by Hindi-speaking servants. Their master's name was never divulged. But
they knew well the routine of the Englishman, and the location of the
observatory.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>And now I must tamper with your destiny, English captain. We
are all—you, I, the prince—captives of a world we no longer can fully control.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He asked himself again why he had made the choice, finally.
To take the risks Jadar had asked, when the odds against the prince were
growing daily. It was stupid to support him now, and Mirza Nuruddin had always
held absolute contempt for stupidity, particularly when it meant supporting a
hopeless cause.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>If the queen crushes him, as she very likely will, I've
jeopardized my position, my holdings, probably my life.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The prince does not understand how difficult my task is. The
infidel Englishman is almost too clever.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I had planned it perfectly. I had shown them the opportunity
for great profit, then denied it to them. They were preparing to leave, but
surely they would have returned, with a fleet. Then Mukarrab Khan approved
their trade, after waiting until he was certain the Portuguese preparations
were almost complete. So now they remain, awaiting their own destruction, never
to leave again. And when these frigates are destroyed, will any English ever
return?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The Englishman will surely be dead, or sent to Goa. There'll
be no trip to Agra. And Arangbar will never know why.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But the silver coin will soon be ready. And the prince's
cipher today said Vasant Rao himself will arrive in ten days to escort the
Englishman and the silver as far as Burhanpur. Time is running out.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>There's only one solution left. Will it work?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The barge eased into the shallows and the porters slid into
the water, each already carrying a roll of cloth.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I expected this difficulty, Captain Hawksworth. But
your</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>path is of
your own making. You yourself chose to unlade at that distance from the
port.&quot; They were in Mirza Nuruddin's chamber, and the Shahbandar faced
Hawksworth and Elkington with his rheumy, fogbound eyes. The chamber had been
emptied, as Hawksworth had demanded. &quot;I propose you consider the
following. Unlade the woolens from your smaller frigate immediately, and let me
oversee their transport here.&quot; He drew nonchalantly on the hookah.
&quot;My fee would be a small commission above the cost of hiring the carts.
One percent if they are delivered here within two weeks. Two percent if they
are delivered within one week. Do you accept?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth decided not to translate the terms for Elkington.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We accept.&quot; It seems fair, he told himself. This
is no time to bargain.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You show yourself reasonable. Now, the lead and
ironwork you have cargoed is another matter. Bullock carts are totally
unsuitable for those weights in this sandy coastal delta. The weights involved
require they be transported by river bark. And that means unlading at the river
mouth.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth shook his head. &quot;We'll dump the cargo first.
We can't take the risk now.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Captain, there is risk and there is risk. What is life
itself if not risk? Without risk what man can call himself alive?&quot; Mirza
Nuruddin thought of his own risk at this moment, how his offer of help to the
English would immediately be misconstrued by the entire port. Until the plan
had played through to its ending. Then the thought of the ending buoyed him and
he continued, his voice full of solicitude. &quot;I can suggest a strategy for
unlading your ironwork at the river mouth in reasonable safety, after your
frigates have been lightened of their wool. With an experienced pilot, you can
sail along the shoreline, south to the bar, and anchor under cover of dark.
Barks can be waiting to unlade you. If the lead and ironwork are ready for
unlading, perhaps it can be completed in one night. You can unlade the smaller
frigate first, return it to the cove you call Swalley, and then unlade the
other vessel. That way only one frigate is exposed at a time.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As Hawksworth and Elkington listened, Mirza Nuruddin outlined
the details of his offer. He would hire whatever men were needed. He normally
did this for foreign traders, and took a percentage from them—as well as from
the meager salary of the men he hired. And he already had a pilot in mind, a
man who knew every shoal and sandbar on the coastline.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As Hawksworth listened his senses suddenly told him to
beware. Hadn't Shirin told him to trust his intuition? And this scheme was too
pat. This time his guts told him to dump the lead in the bay and write off the
loss. But Elkington would never agree. He would want to believe they could
unlade and sell the lead. His responsibility was profit on the cargo, not the
risk of a vessel.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>So he would take this final risk. Perhaps Mirza Nuruddin was
right. Risk exhilarated.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He smiled inwardly and thought again of Shirin. And of what
she had said about trusting his instincts.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then, ignoring them, he agreed to Mirza Nuruddin's plan.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>And the Shahbandar produced a document already prepared for
their signature.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>     
&quot;Now we will begin. As my guest, you have first throw of the dice.&quot;
Mirza Nuruddin fingered the gold and ivory inlay of the wooden dice cup as he
passed it to Hawksworth. Then he drew a heavy gurgle of smoke from his hookah,
savoring the way it raced his heart for that brief instant before its marvelous
calm washed over his nerves. He needed the calm. He knew that any plan, even
one as carefully conceived as the one tonight, could fail through the
blundering of incompetents. Or betrayal. But tonight, he told himself, tonight
you will win the game.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The marble-paved inner court of the Shahbandar's sprawling
brick estate house was crowded almost to overflowing: with wealthy Hindu
money-lenders, whose mercenary hearts were as black as their robes were white;
Muslim port officials in silks and jewels, private riches gleaned at public
expense; the turbaned captains of Arab cargo ships anchored at the bar, hard
men in varicolored robes who sat sweltering, smoking, and drinking steaming
coffee; and a sprinkling of Portuguese in starched doublets, the captains and
officers of the three Portuguese trading frigatta now anchored at the bar
downriver.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Servants wearing only white loincloths circulated decanters
of wine and boxes of rolled betel leaves as an antidote to the stifling air
that lingered even now, almost at midnight, from a broiling day. The
torchbearers of Mirza Nuruddin's household stood on the balconies continuously
dousing a mixture of coconut oil and rose attar onto their huge flambeaux.
Behind latticework screens the <i>nautch</i> girls waited in boredom, braiding
their hair, smoothing their skintight trousers, inspecting themselves in the
ring-mirror on their right thumb, and chewing betel. The dancing would not
begin until well after midnight.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As Hawksworth took the dice cup, the sweating crowd fell
expectantly silent, and for the first time he noticed the gentle splash of the
river below them, through the trees.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He stared for a moment at the lined board lying on the carpet
between them, then he wished himself luck and tossed the three dice along its
side. They were ivory and rectangular, their four long sides numbered one, two,
five, and six with inlaid teakwood dots. He had thrown a one and two sixes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;A propitious start. You English embrace fortune as a
Brahmin his birthright.&quot; The Shahbandar turned and smiled toward the
Portuguese captains loitering behind him, who watched mutely, scarcely masking
their displeasure at being thrown together with the heretic English captain.
But an invitation from the Shahbandar was not something a prudent trader
declined. &quot;The night will be long, however. This is only your
beginning.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth passed the cup to the Shahbandar and stared at the
board, trying to understand the rules of <i>chaupar</i>, the favorite game of
India from the Moghul’s <i>zenana </i>to the lowliest loitering scribe. The
board was divided into four quadrants and a central square, using two sets of
parallel lines, which formed a large cross in its middle. Each quadrant was
divided into three rows, marked with spaces for moving pieces. Two or four
could play, and each player had four pieces of colored teak that were placed
initially at the back of two of the three spaced rows. After each dice throw,
pieces were moved forward one or more spaces in a row until reaching its end,
then up the next row, until they reached the square in the center. A piece
reaching the center was called <i>rasida</i>, arrived.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Hawksworth remembered that a double six allowed him
to move two of his pieces, those standing together, a full twelve spaces ahead.
As he moved the pieces forward, groans and oaths in a number of languages
sounded through the night air. Betting had been heavy on the Shahbandar, who
had challenged both Hawksworth and the senior Portuguese captain to a set of
games. Only an adventurous few in the crowd would straddle their wagers and
accept the long odds that the English captain would, or could, be so
impractical as to defeat the man who must value and apply duty to his goods.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Did I tell you, Captain Hawksworth, that <i>chaupar </i>was
favored by the Great Moghul, Akman?&quot; The Shahbandar rattled the dice in
the cup for a long moment. &quot;There's a story, hundreds of years old, that
once a ruler of India sent the game of chess, what we call <i>chaturanga</i> in
India, to Persia as a challenge to their court. They in return sent <i>chaupar</i>
to India.&quot; He paused dramatically. &quot;It's a lie invented by a
Persian.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He led the explosion of laughter and threw the dice. A
servant called the numbers and the laughter died as suddenly as it had come.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The Merciful Prophet's wives were serpent-tongued
Bengalis.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He had thrown three ones.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>A terrified servant moved the pieces while Mirza Nuruddin
took a betel leaf from a tray and munched it sullenly. The crowd's tension was
almost palpable.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth took the cup and swirled it again. He absently
noted that the moon had emerged from the trees and was now directly overhead.
The Shahbandar seemed to notice it as well.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Mackintosh watched as the last grains of red marble sand
slipped through the two-foot-high hourglass by the binnacle and then he
mechanically flipped it over. The moon now cast the shadow of the mainmast yard
precisely across the waist of the ship, and the tide had begun to flow in
rapidly. The men of the new watch were silently working their way up the
shrouds.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Midnight. The tide's up. There's nae need to wait
more.&quot; He turned to Captain Kerridge, who stood beside him on the
quarterdeck of the <i>Resolve</i>. George Elkington stood directly behind
Kerridge.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Let's get under sail.&quot; Elkington tapped out his
pipe on the railing. Then he turned to Kerridge. &quot;Did you remember to
douse the stern lantern?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I give the orders, Mr. Elkington. And you can save your
questions for the pilot.&quot; Captain Jonathan Kerridge was a small, weasel-faced
man with no chin and large bulging eyes. He signaled the <i>Resolve</i>’s
quartermaster and the anchor chain began to rattle slowly up the side. Then the
mainsail dropped, hung slack for a moment, and bellied against the wind,
sending a groan through the mast. They were underway. The only light on board
was a small, shielded lantern by the binnacle, for reading the large boxed
compass.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The needle showed their course to be almost due south, toward
the bar at the mouth of the Tapti. On their right was the empty bay and on
their left the glimmer of occasional fires from the shoreline. The whipstaff
had been taken by the Indian pilot, a wrinkled nut-brown man the Shahbandar had
introduced as Ahmet. He spoke a smattering of Portuguese and had succeeded in
explaining that he could reliably cover the eight-mile stretch south from
Swalley to the unloading bar at the Tapti river mouth in one turn of the
hourglass, if Allah willed. With high tide, he had also managed to explain,
there were only two sandbars they would have to avoid.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>And there would be no hostiles abroad this night. Even the
Portuguese trading frigates were safely at anchor off the river mouth, for this
evening their captains had been honored by an invitation to attend the
gathering at Mirza Nuruddin's estate.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Your beginning has been impressive, Captain Hawksworth.
But now you must still maintain your advantage.&quot; Mirza Nuruddin watched as
Hawksworth threw a double five and a two, advancing two of his four pieces into
the central square. The crowd groaned, coins began to change hands. &quot;You
have gained <i>rasida </i>for two pieces. I'll save time and concede this game.
But we have six more to play. <i>Chaupar </i>is a bit like life. It favors
those with endurance.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As the board was cleared for the next game, Mirza Nuruddin
rose and strode to the end of the court. The wind was coming up now, as it
always did on this monthly night of full moon and tide, sweeping up the river
bringing the fresh salt air of the sea. And the currents would be shifting
along the coast, as sandbars one by one were submerged by the incoming tide. He
barked an inconsequential order to a hovering servant and then made his way
back to the board, his guests parting automatically before him. The drinking
crowd had already begun to turn boisterous, impatient for the appearance of the
women. As always, the <i>nautch </i>girls would remain for additional
entertainment after their dance, in private quarters available in the rambling
new palace.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;This game I will throw first.&quot; The Shahbandar
seated himself, and watched as Hawksworth drew on a tankard of brandy,
especially provided for the Europeans present. Then Mirza Nuruddin made a deft
twist of the cup and the ivories dropped on the carpet in a neat row of three
sixes. A servant</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>barked the
numbers and the crowd pressed forward as one to watch.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>       
&quot;Fifteen fathom and falling.&quot; The bosun leaned back from the railing
and shouted toward the quarterdeck. In disbelief he quickly drew the line in
over the gunwale at the waist of the <i>Resolve</i> and fed it out again.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>       &quot;Now
she reads thirteen fathom.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>        
Kerridge glanced at the hourglass. The sand was half gone, and the compass
reading still gave their course as due south. Ahead the sea was blind dark but
on the left the fires of shore still flickered, now perhaps even brighter than
he had remembered them. Then he realized a cloud had drifted momentarily over
the moon, and he told himself this was why. The pilot held the whipstaff on a
steady course.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>       
&quot;I'd reef the foresail a notch, Cap'n, and ease her two points to
starboard. I'll lay a hundred sovereigns the current's chang'd on us.&quot;
Mackintosh ventured to break protocol and speak, his concern growing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>        I
dinna like the feel of this, he told himself. We're driftin' too fast. I can
feel it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>      
&quot;Eight fathoms, sir.&quot; The bosun's voice again cut the dark.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>      
&quot;Jesus, Cap'n,&quot; Mackintosh erupted. &quot;Take her about. The
pox-rotted current's . ..&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>      
&quot;She'll ride in three fathom. I've sailed the James, six hundred ton, in
less. Let her run.&quot; He turned to Elkington. &quot;Ask the Moor how much
longer to the river mouth.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>       
George Elkington turned and shot a stream of questions rapidly at the pilot,
whose eyes glazed in his partial comprehension. He shook his head in a way that
seemed to mean both yes and no simultaneously and then pointed into the dark
and shrugged, emitting fragments of Portuguese.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>         
&quot;<i>Em frente Sahib. Diretamente em frente.</i>&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>           Then he gestured toward the waist of the ship
and seemed to be asking the depth reading.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>          As
though in answer, the bosun's voice came again, trembling.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>        
&quot;Five fathom, Cap'n, and still dropping.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>        
&quot;Cinco.&quot; Elkington translated, but his concerned tone was</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>a question.
What does it mean?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The pilot shouted an alarm in Gujarati and threw his fragile
weight against the whipstaff. The <i>Resolve</i> pitched and shuddered,
groaning like some mourning animal at tether, but it no longer seemed to
respond to the rudder.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Kerridge glared at the pilot in dismay.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Tell the blathering heathen steady as she goes. She'll
take—“</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The deck tipped crazily sideways, and a low grind seemed to
pass up through its timbers. Then the whipstaff kicked to port, strained
against its rope, and with a snap from somewhere below, drifted free. The <i>Resolve
</i>careened dangerously into the wind, while a wave caught the waist of the
ship and swept the bosun and his sounding line into the dark.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Whorin' Mary, Mother of God, we've lost the
rudder.&quot; Mackintosh lunged down the companionway toward the main deck,
drawing a heavy knife from his belt. As the frightened seamen clung to the
tilting deck and braced themselves against the shrouds, he began slashing the
lines securing the main sail.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Another wave seemed to catch the <i>Resolve</i> somewhere
beneath her stern quarter gallery and lifted her again. She poised in midair
for a long moment, then groaned farther into the sand. As the frigate tipped,
Mackintosh felt a rumble from the deck below and at that instant he knew with
perfect certainty the <i>Resolve </i>was doomed to go down. A cannon had
snapped its securing lines and jumped its blocks. He grabbed a shroud and
braced himself.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then it came, the muffled sound of splintering as the cannon
bore directly through the hull, well below the waterline of the heeling
frigate.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Takin' water in the hold.&quot; A frightened shout
trailed out through the scuttles.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The seamen on decks still clung to the shrouds, wedging
themselves against the gunwales.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Man the pumps in the well, you fatherless pimps.&quot;
Mackintosh shouted at the paralyzed seamen, knowing it was already too late,
and then he began to sever the moorings of the longboat lashed to the mainmast.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Elkington was clinging to the lateen mast, winding a safety
line about his waist and bellowing unintelligible instructions into the dark
for hoisting the chests of silver bullion from the hold.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>No one on the quarterdeck had noticed when its railing
splintered, sending Captain Kerridge and the Indian pilot into the dark sea.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The strumpet luck seems to have switched her men
tonight, Captain Hawksworth, like a <i>nautch</i> girl when her <i>karwa</i>'s
rupees are spent.&quot; Mirza Nuruddin signaled for his hookah to be relighted.
He had just thrown another row of three sixes, and was now near to taking the
seventh game, giving him six to Hawksworth's one. All betting on Hawksworth had
stopped after the fourth game. &quot;But the infinite will of God is always
mysterious, mercifully granting us what we need more often than what we
want.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth had studied the last throw carefully, through the
haze of brandy, and he suddenly realized Mirza Nuruddin had been cheating.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>By Jesus, the dice are weighted. He sets them up somehow in
the cup, then slides them quickly across the carpet. Damn me if he's not a
thief. But why bother to cheat me? I only laid five sovereigns on the game.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He pushed aside the confusion and reflected again on the
astounding genius who sat before him now, cheating at dice.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>His plan was masterful. Host a gathering for the captains at
the bar the night we will unload. Even the Portuguese. No one in command of a
ship will be at the river mouth, no one who could possibly interfere. All our
wool's already been unladed and brought overland to Surat. Then we transferred
the ironwork and lead on the <i>Discovery </i>to the <i>Resolve</i>. So all the
lead and ironwork in cargo will be unladed by moonlight tonight and on its way
upriver by morning, before the Portugals here even sleep off their liquor.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>And the <i>Resolve </i>will be underway again by dawn, back
to Swalley with no one to challenge her. Not even the Portuguese trading
frigatta, with their laughable eight-pound stern chasers. The <i>Discovery </i>is
almost laded with cotton. Another couple of days should finish her. And then
the <i>Resolve</i>. Another two week at most, and they'll be underway.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The East India Company, the Worshipful damned East India
Company, will earn a fortune on this voyage. And a certain captain named Brian
Hawksworth will be toasted the length of Cheapside as the man who did what
Lancaster couldn't. The man who sent the East India Company's frigates home
with a cargo of the cheapest pepper in history. The Butterbox Hollanders will
be buying pepper from the East India Company next year and cursing Captain
Brian Hawksworth.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Or will it be Sir Brian Hawksworth?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He tried the name on his tongue as he swirled the dice for
one last throw. This time he tried to duplicate the Shahbandar's technique.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Easy swirls and then just let them slide onto the carpet as
you make some distracting remark.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Perhaps it's Allah's will that a man make his own luck.
Is that written somewhere?&quot; The dice slid onto the carpet and Hawksworth
reached for his brandy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Three sixes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Mirza Nuruddin studied the three ivories indifferently as he
drew on his hookah. But traces of a smile showed at the corner of his lips and
his foggy eyes sparkled for an instant.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You see, Captain Hawksworth, you never know the hand of
fortune till you play to the end.&quot; He motioned to a servant. &quot;Refresh
the English captain's glass. I think he's starting to learn our game.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The longboat scraped crazily across the deck and into the
surf. Then another wave washed over the deck, chilling the half-naked seamen
who struggled to secure the longboat's line. Two chests of silver bullion,
newly hoisted from the hold, were now wedged against the mainmast. Elkington
clung to their handles, shouting between waves for the seamen to lower them
into the longboat.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Mackintosh ignored him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Hoist the line to the poop. We'll board her from the
stern gallery. Take the longboat under and drop a ladder. You and you, Garway
and Davies, bring the line about, to the gallery rail.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The current tugged at the longboat, but its line held secure
and the seamen passed the end up the companionway and toward the stern gallery,
where the rope ladder was being played out.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The longboat'll not take all the men and the silver.
Blessed Jesus, there's ten thousand pound sterling in these chests.&quot;
Elkington gasped as another wave washed over him, sending his hat into the
surf. He seized a running seaman by the neck and yanked him toward the chests.
&quot;Take one end, you whoreson bastard, and help hoist it through the
companionway to the poop.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But the man twisted free and disappeared toward the stem.
With an oath, Elkington began dragging the chest across the deck and down the
companionway. By the time he reached the gallery, the ladder had already been
dropped into the longboat.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>And five seamen were waiting with half-pikes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'll send you to hell if you try loadin' that
chest.&quot; Bosun's mate John Garway held his pike in Elkington's face.
&quot;We'll all not make it as 'tis.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then Thomas Davies, acting on the thought in every man's
mind, thrust his pike through the lock hinge on the chest and wrenched it off
with a single powerful twist. &quot;Who needs the money more, say I, the
bleedin' Worshipful Company, or a man who knows how to spend it?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>In moments a dozen hands had ripped away the lid of the
chest, and seamen began shoveling coins into their pockets. Elkington was
pushed sprawling into the companionway. Other seamen ran to begin rifling the
second chest. Silver spilled from their pockets as the men poured down the
swaying ladder into the longboat. As Elkington fought his way back toward the
stem, he took a long last look at the half-empty chests, then began stuffing
the pockets of his own doublet.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Mackintosh emerged from the Great Cabin holding the ship's
log. As he waited for the last seaman to board the longboat, he too lightened
the <i>Resolve </i>of a pocketful of silver.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>With all men on board the longboat's gunwales rode a
scant three inches above waterline. Bailing began after the first wave washed
over her. Then they hoisted sail and began to row for the dark shore.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Tonight you may have been luckier than you suppose,
Captain Hawksworth.&quot; The Shahbandar's fingers deftly counted the five
sovereigns through the leather pouch Hawksworth had handed him. Around them the
final side bets were being placed against the Portuguese captain who would play
Mirza Nuruddin next.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It's hard to see how.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;For the price of a mere five sovereigns, Captain,
you've learned a truth some men fail to master in a lifetime.&quot; Mirza
Nuruddin motioned away the Portuguese captain, his doublet stained with wine,
who waited to take his place at the board. &quot;I really must call the dancers
now, lest some of my old friends lose regard for our hospitality. I hope you'll
find them entertaining, Captain Hawksworth. If you've never seen the <i><u>nautch</u></i>,
you've yet to call yourself a man.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth pulled himself up and thought about the river and
slowly worked his way through the crowd to the edge of the marble court. The
damp, chill air purged the torch smoke from his lungs and began to sweep away
the haze of brandy from his brain. He stared into the dark and asked the winds
if they knew of the <i>Resolve</i>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Could it all have been a trap? What if he'd told the
Portugals, and they had warships waiting?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Without warning, the slow, almost reverent strains of a
sarangi, the Indian violin, stirred from the corner of the courtyard, and the
crowd shifted expectantly. Hawksworth turned to notice that a carpeted platform
had been erected directly in the center of the court, and as he watched, a
group of women, perhaps twenty, slowly began to mount steps along its side. The
torches had grown dim, but he could still see enough to tell they all wore the
veil of purdah and long skirts over their trousers. As they moved chastely
toward the center of the platform he thought they looked remarkably like
village women going to a well, save they wore rows of tiny bells around their
ankles and heavy bangles on their wrists.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The air was rent by a burst of drumming, and the courtyard
suddenly flared as servants threw oil on the smoldering torches around the
balcony. At that instant, in a gesture of high drama, the women ripped away
their turquoise veils and flung them skyward. The crowd erupted in a roar.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth stared at the women in astonishment.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Their skirts, the skintight trousers beneath, and their short
halters—were all gossamer, completely transparent.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The dance was underway. Hips jerked spasmodically, in perfect
time with the drummer's accelerating, hypnotic rhythms—arching now to the side,
now suggestively forward. Hawksworth found himself exploring the dancers'
mask-like faces, all heavily painted and expressionless. Then he watched their
hands, which moved in sculptural arcs through a kind of sign language certain
Indians in the crowd seemed to know. Other hand messages were understood by
all, as the women stroked themselves intimately, in what seemed almost a parody
of sensuality. As the rhythm continued to intensify, they begap to rip away
their garments one by one, beginning with their parted waist wraps. Next their
halters were thrown to the crowd, though their breasts had long since found
release from whatever minimal containment they might have known at the
beginning of the dance. Their earth-brown skin now glistened bare in the
perfumed torchlight.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The dance seemed to Hawksworth to go on and on, incredibly
building to ever more frantic levels of intensity. The drunken crowd swayed
with the women, its excitement and expectation swelling. Then at last the
women's trousers also were ripped away, leaving them adorned with only bangles
and reflecting jewels. Yet the dance continued still, as they writhed onto
their knees at the edge of the platform. Then slowly, as though by some unseen
hand, the platform lowered to the level of the courtyard and they glided into
the drunken crowd, thrusting breasts, thighs, against the ecstatic onlookers.
The cheers had grown deafening.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth finally turned away and walked slowly down the
embankment to the river. There, in the first hint of dawn, bathers had begun to
assemble for Hindu prayers and a ritual morning bath. Among them were young
village girls, swathed head to foot in bright-colored wraps, who descended one
by one into the chilled water and began to modestly change garments while they
bathed, chastely coiling a fresh cloth around themselves even as the other was
removed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>They had never seemed more beautiful.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth was standing on the steps of the maidan when the
sail of the English longboat showed at the turn of the river. News of the
shipwreck had reached Surat by village runner an hour after sunup, and barks
had already been sent to try to recover the remaining silver before the ship
broke apart. The frigate was reportedly no more than a thousand yards off the
coast, and all the men, even Kerridge, the bosun, and the pilot, had been
safely carried ashore by the current.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth watched the longboat's sail being lowered in
preparation for landing and tried to think over his next step, how to minimize the
delay and loss.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>We can't risk staying on past another day or two, not with
only one vessel. If we're caught at anchor in the cove, there's nothing one
ship can do. The Portugals can send in fireships and there'll be no way to sink
them with crossfire. The <i>Discovery </i>has to sail immediately. We've enough
cotton laded now to fill the hold with pepper in Java.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Damn Kerridge. Why was he steering so close to shore? Didn't
he realize there'd be a current?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Or was it the pilot?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Were we steered into this disaster on the orders of our new
friend Mirza Nuruddin? Has he been playing false with us all along, only
claiming to help us stay clear of the Portugals? By the looks of the traders on
the <i>maidan</i> this morning I can tell they all think we were played for
fools.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He tried to remember all the Shahbandar had said the night
before, particularly the remarks he had not understood, but now the evening
seemed swallowed in a fog of brandy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But the game, he finally realized, had been more than a game.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The voyage will be lucky to break even now.&quot;
George Elkington slid from the back of the sweating porter and collapsed
heavily on the stone steps. &quot;The <i>Resolve </i>was old, but 'twill take
forty thousand pound to replace her.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What do you plan to do?&quot; Hawksworth eyed Kerridge
as he mounted the steps, his doublet unrecognizable under the smeared mud, and
decided to ignore him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Not a damn'd thing we can do now, save lade the last of
the cotton and some indigo on the <i>Discovery</i> and weigh anchor. And day
after tomorrow's not too soon, by my thinkin'.&quot; Elkington examined
Hawksworth and silently cursed him. He still had not swallowed his disbelief
when Hawksworth had announced, only three days before, that he planned to leave
the ships and travel to Agra with a letter from King James.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The Shahbandar has asked to meet with you.&quot;
Hawksworth motioned to Elkington as the last seaman climbed over the side of
the longboat and onto the back of a waiting porter. &quot;We may as well go
in.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>A crowd of the curious swarmed about them as they made their
way across the <i>maidan</i> and through the customs house. Mirza Nuruddin was
waiting on his bolster.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Captain, my sincere condolences to you and to Mr.
Elkington. Please be sure that worthless pilot will never work out of this port
again. I cannot believe he was at fault, but he'll be dealt with
nonetheless.&quot; Which is partially true, Mirza Nuruddin told himself, since
my cousin Muhammad Haidar, <i>nakuda </i>of the Rahimi, will take him on the
pilgrim ship for the next Aden run, and allow him to work there until his reputation
is repaired. &quot;You were fortunate, at least, that the largest part of her
cargo had already been unladed.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Elkington listened to Hawksworth's translation, his face
growing ever more florid. &quot;'Twas the damned pilot's knavery. Tell him I'd
see him hanged if this was England.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Mirza Nuruddin listened, then sighed. &quot;Perhaps the pilot
was at fault, perhaps not. I don't quite know whose story to believe. But you
should know that in India only the Moghul can impose the death penalty. This
matter of the pilot is past saving, however. It's best we move on. So tell me,
what do you propose to do now?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Settle our accounts, weigh anchor, and be gone.&quot;
Elkington bristled. &quot;But you've not heard the last o' the East India
Company, I'll warrant you. We'll be back with a fleet soon enough, and next
time we'll do our own hirin' of a pilot.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;As you wish. I'll have our accountants total your
invoices.&quot; Mirza Nuruddin face did not change as he heard the translation,
but his spirit exulted.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It worked! They'll be well at sea within the week, days
before the Portuguese warships arrive. Not even that genius of intrigue
Mukarrab Khan will know I planned it all. And by saving these greedy English
from certain disaster, I've lured to our seas the only Europeans with the
spirit to drive out the Portuguese forever, after a century of humiliation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>India's historic tradition of free trade, the Shahbandar had
often thought, had also brought her undoing. Open-handed to all who came to buy
and sell, India had thrived since the beginning of time. Until the Portuguese
came.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>In those forgotten days huge single-masted arks, vast as
eight hundred tons, freely plied the length of the Arabian Sea. From Mecca's
Jidda they came, groaning with the gold, silver, copper, wool, and brocades of
Italy, Greece, Damascus, or with the pearls, horses, silks of Persia and
Afghanistan. They put in at India's northern port of Cambay, where they laded
India's prized cotton, or sailed farther south, to India's port of Calicut,
where they bargained for the hard black pepper of India's Malabar Coast, for
ginger and cinnamon from Ceylon. India's own merchants sailed eastward, to the
Moluccas, where they bought silks and porcelains from Chinese traders, or
cloves, nutmeg, and mace from the islanders. India's ports linked China on the
east with Europe on the west, and touched all that moved between. The Arabian
Sea was free as the air, and the richest traders who sailed it prayed to Allah,
the One True God.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then, a hundred years ago, the Portuguese came. They seized
strategic ocean outlooks from the mouth of the Persian Gulf to the coast of
China. On these they built strongholds, forts to control not the lands of Asia,
but its seas. And if no man could remember the centuries of freedom, today all
knew well the simple device that held the Arabian Sea in bondage. It was a
small slip of paper, on which was the signature of a Portuguese governor or the
captain of a Portuguese fort. Today no vessel, not even the smallest bark,
dared venture the Arabian Sea without a Portuguese <i>cartaz</i>. This hated
license must name the captain of a vessel and verify its tonnage, its cargo,
its crew, its destination, and its armament. Vessels could trade only at ports
controlled or approved by the Portuguese, where they must pay a duty of 8
percent on all cargo in and out. Indian and Arab vessels no longer could carry
spices, pepper, copper, or iron—the richest cargo and now the monopoly of
Portuguese shippers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>An Indian vessel caught at sea without a <i>cartaz</i>, or
steering south when its stated destination was north, was confiscated; its
captain and crew were executed immediately, if they were lucky, or sent to the
galleys if they were not. Fleets of armed galleons cruised the coastlines in
patrol. If a vessel gave cause for suspicion, Portuguese soldiers boarded her
in full battle dress, with naked swords and battle cries of
&quot;Santiago.&quot; And while their commander inspected the ship's <i>cartaz</i>,
Portuguese soldiers relieved passengers of any jewelry salable in the streets
of Goa. <i>Cartaz</i> enforcement was strict, and—since a percentage of all
seized cargo went to captains and crews of patrol galleons—enthusiastic. The
seas off India were theirs by right, the Portuguese liked to explain, because
they were the first ever to have the ingenuity to make claim to them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The revenues the <i>cartaz </i>brought Portugal were
immense—not because it was expensive to obtain, it cost only a few rupees, but
because it funneled every ounce of commodity traded in the Arabian Sea through
a Portuguese tax port.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>And it is the Portuguese taxes, Mirza Nuruddin told himself,
not just their galleons, that the English will one day drive from our ports.
And on that day, our merchant ships will again lade the best cargo, sail the
richest routes, return with the boldest profits.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;There seems nothing further then, Mr. Elkington, I can
do for you.&quot; The Shahbandar smiled and bowed his small, ceremonial salaam.
&quot;Save wish you a fair wind and Allah's blessing.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>So it's over, Hawksworth thought as they turned to leave, the
last time I'll ever see you, and thank you very much, you unscrupulous
deceiving son of a whore.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Captain Hawksworth, perhaps you and I can share a
further word. You are not, as I understand, planning to depart India. At least
not immediately. I'd like you always to know my modest offices remain at your
behest.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Elkington paused, as did Hawksworth, but one of the
Shahbandar's officials took the merchant's arm and urged him firmly toward the
door of the chamber. Too firmly, Hawksworth thought.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I think you've done about all for us you can.&quot;
Hawksworth made no attempt to strain the irony from his voice.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Be that as it may, I've heard rumors that your trip to
Agra may be approved. Should that happen, you must know you cannot travel
alone, Captain. No man in India is that foolhardy. The roads here are no more
safe than those, so I hear, in Europe. All travelers inland need a guide, and
an armed escort.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Are you proposing to help me secure a guide? Equal in
competence, may I presume, to the pilot you hired for the <i>Resolve</i>?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;Captain Hawksworth, please. God's will is
mysterious.&quot; He sighed. &quot;No man can thwart mischance if it is his
destiny. Hear me out. I have just learned there's currently a man in Surat who
knows the road to Burhanpur like his own sword handle. In fact, he only just
arrived from the east, and I understand he expects to return when his affairs
here, apparently brief, are <i>Resolve</i>d. By a fortuitous coincidence he
happens to have an armed escort of guards with him. I suggest it might be wise
to attempt to engage him while you still have a chance.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And who is this man?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;A Rajput captain with the army. A soldier of no small
reputation, I can assure you. His name is Vasant Rao.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Mukarrab Khan reread the order carefully, scrutinized the
black ink seal at the top of the page to assure himself it was indeed the
Moghul’s, and then placed it aside. So at last it had come. The prospect of
English presents was too great a temptation for the acquisitive Arangbar, ever
anxious for new baubles. The Englishman would be going to Agra. No one at court
could have prevented it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But that road—east through bandit-infested Chopda to
now-threatened Burhanpur, then north, the long road through Mandu, Ujjain, and
Gwalior to Agra—was a journey of two hard months. The Moghul’s seal meant less
than nothing to highwaymen, or to servants and drivers whose loyalties were
always for sale. It's a long road, Englishman, and mishaps on that road are
common as summer mildew.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He smiled to himself and took up the other silver-trimmed
bamboo tube. It had arrived by the same runner. The date on the outside was one
week old.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It always amazed Mukarrab Khan that India's runners, the
Mewras, were actually swifter than post horses. This message had traveled the
three hundred <i>kos </i>south from Agra to Burhanpur and then the remaining
hundred and fifty <i>kos </i>west to Surat—a combined distance of almost seven
hundred English miles—in only seven days.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Runners were stationed at posts spaced five <i>kos </i>apart
along the great road that Akman had built to link Agra to the seaport of Surat.
They wore an identifying plume at their head and two bells at their belt, and
they gained energy by eating <i>postibangh</i>, a mixture of opium and hemp
extract.  Akman even conceived of lining the sides of the road with white
stones so his Mewras could run in darkest midnight without lanterns. There were
now some four thousand runners stationed along India's five main arteries.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The only things swifter, Mukarrab Khan had often told
himself, are lightning . . . and a blue, white-throated Rath pigeon. A distance
requiring a full day for a runner could be covered by a pigeon in one <i>pahar</i>,
three hours, given good weather. Arangbar kept pigeons all over India, even in
Surat—but then so did everyone else at court. Recently, it seemed, everyone was
training pigeons.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Next to the date was the seal of Nadir Sharif, prime minister
and brother of the queen. Mukarrab Khan knew Nadir Sharif well. A dispatch from
Nadir Sharif, though it always reflected the wishes of the Moghul or the queen,
could be relied upon to be reasonable. If the Moghul in fury condemned a man
over some trivial transgression, Nadir Sharif always forgot to deliver the
sentence until the next day, having found that Arangbar often tended to reverse
sentences of death when musing in his evening wine cups. This order will be
reasonable, Mukarrab Khan told himself, but it will have to be obeyed,
eventually.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As always, Mukarrab Khan tried to guess the message before
unsealing the two-inch-long silver cap attached to the end of the tube.
Probably taxes, late delivery. Or perhaps there's been a discrepancy between
the open report filed from my chamber by the wakianavis, the public reportefs,
and the private report, which I supposedly do not see, sent directly to the
Moghul by the harkaras, the confidential reporters. And if that's the
complaint, it will disprove my suspicion that no one in the Imperial chancery
ever actually reads the reports. I deliberately inserted a difference of
one-half lakh of rupees as reported logged at the mint last month, just to see
if they would catch it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Mukarrab Khan unrolled the dispatch. And his heart stopped.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Clasping the paper he wandered distractedly out of the
now-empty audience hall and down the stairs toward the courtyard. When he
reached the veranda he only half-noted the heavy clouds threatening in the
west, toward the sea, and the moist air promising one last spatter of the
monsoon. Servants were removing the tapestried canopy that shaded his cushioned
bench, and when they saw him they discreetly melted out of sight, leaving one side
of the cloth still dangling from the poles. He dropped heavily onto the bench
and reread the order carefully, his disbelief growing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>On the recommendation of Queen Janahara, Mukarrab Khan had
just been appointed India's first ambassador to Portuguese Goa. He would leave
in two weeks.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>      The
moon was high, bathing the sleeping veranda in a wash of glistening silver, and
the air was deliciously moist, heavy with perfume from the garden below. From
somewhere among the distant rooftops came the thread of a man's voice, intoning
a high-pitched melody, trilling out wordless syllables like some intense poetry
of sound.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth leaned back against one of the carved juniper-wood
posts supporting the canopy above his sleeping couch and explored Kali's body
with his gaze, as a mariner might search a map for unknown islands and inlets.
She lounged opposite him, resting against an oblong velvet bolster, examining
him with half-shut eyes while she drew contentedly on a hookah fired with black
tobacco and a concentrated <i>bhang </i>the Arabs called <i>hashish</i>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Her hair hung loose, in gleaming black strands reaching
almost to her waist, and her head was circled by a thin tiara of gold and
pearls, supporting the large green emerald that always hung suspended in the
center of her forehead—even when she made love. The gold she wore—long
bracelets at her wrists and upper arms, swinging earrings, even tiny bells at
her ankles—seemed to excite her in a way Hawksworth could never understand. Her
eyes and eyebrows were kohl-darkened and her lips carefully painted a deep red,
matching the color of her fingernails and toenails. And as always she had dyed
her palms and the soles of her feet red with henna. Four different strands of
pearls hung in perfect array beneath her transparent blouse, glistening white
against her delicate, amber-tinted skin. He noticed, too, that her nipples had
been rouged, and told himself this was the only thing about her that recalled
the women in London.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Tonight your thoughts were far away, my love. Do you
weary of me so soon?&quot; She laid aside the <i>rome-chauri</i>, the rubber
ring impregnated with powdered hair that she often asked him to wear for her,
then took a vial of rose attar from beside the couch and dabbed herself
absently along the arms. &quot;Tell me the truth. Are you now beginning to
recoil from women, like so many bragging and posturing men I've known, and to
long for a boy who fears to seek his own pleasure? Or a subservient <i>feringhi
</i>woman whose parts are dry from lack of desire?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth studied her for a moment without replying. In
truth he did not know what to say. Your nightly visits to this couch have been
the most astonishing experience of my life. To imagine I once thought being
with the same woman night after night would eventually grow monotonous. But you
always come here as someone different, always with something new. You play on
my senses like an instrument—with touch, with scent, with tongue. Until they
seem to merge with my mind. Or is it the reverse? But you're right when you say
the mind must surrender itself first. When that's done, when the mind is given
up to the body, then you somehow forget your own self and think only of the
other. And eventually there grows a union of pleasure, a bond that's intense,
overwhelming.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But tonight he could not repress his vagrant mind. His
feeling of failure churned too deep. It had stolen his spirit.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Day after tomorrow the <i>Discovery</i> weighs anchor, he
told himself, with half the cargo we'd planned and twice the men she needs,
while the <i>Resolve</i> slowly breaks apart on a sandbar. I've failed the
Company . . . and myself. And there's nothing that can be done. Kali, dear
Kali. The woman I really want to be with tonight is Shirin. Why can't I drive
her from my mind? Half the time when you're in my arms, I pretend you're her.
Do you sense that too?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>        
&quot;I'm sorry. I'm not myself tonight.&quot; You're right as always, he
marveled, the mind and the body are one. As he paused, the singer's voice cut
the stillness between them. &quot;How did you know?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>

&quot;You do it very well. It's just that sometimes there's too much to
lift.&quot; He studied her, wondering what she was really thinking, then leaned
back and looked at the stars. &quot;Tell me, what do you do when the world
weighs on you!&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>       
&quot;That's never your worry, my love. I'm here to think of you, not you of
me.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>      
&quot;Tell me anyway. Say it's a <i>feringhi’s</i> curiosity.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>        
&quot;What do I do?&quot; She smiled wistfully and drew again on the hookah,
sending a tiny gurgle into the quiet. &quot;I escape with <i>bhang</i>. And I
remember when I was in Agra, in the <i>zenana</i>.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>       She lay aside the mouthpiece of the hookah and
began to roll betel leaves for them both, carefully measuring in a portion of
nutmeg, her favorite aphrodisiac.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>      
&quot;Tell me how you came to be here, away from Agra.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>      
&quot;Is it really me you wish to hear about?&quot; She looked at him squarely,
her voice quiet. &quot;Or is it Shirin?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>      
&quot;You,&quot; Hawksworth lied, and absently stroked the edge of her foot,
where the henna line began. Then he looked into her dark eyes and he knew she
knew.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>       
&quot;Will we make love again if I tell you?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>       
&quot;Possibly.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>       
&quot;I know how to make you keep your promise.&quot; She took his toe in her
mouth and brushed it playfully with her tongue before biting it, ever so
lightly. &quot;So I will tell you anything you want to know.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>       He
scarcely knew where to start.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>&quot;What
was it about the harem, the <i>zenana</i>, that you liked so much?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>         She
sighed. &quot;We had everything there. Wine and sweet</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>bhang</span></i><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>. And we bribed the eunuchs to bring
us opium and nutmeg and tobacco. We could wear tight trousers, which none of
the women here in Surat dare for fear the mullahs will condemn them.&quot; As
she spoke, her eyes grew distant. &quot;We wore jewels the way women in Surat
wear scarves. And silks from China the way they wear their dreary cotton here.
There was always music, dance, pigeon-flying. And we had all the perfumes—musk,
scented oil, attar of rose—we could want. The Moghul had melons brought by
runner from Kabul, pomegranates and pears from Samarkand, apples from Kashmir,
pineapples from Goa.&quot; She remembered herself and reached to place a rolled
betel leaf in his mouth.          &quot;About the only thing we weren't
supposed to have was cucumbers . . .&quot; She giggled and took a betel leaf
for herself. &quot;I think His Majesty was afraid he might suffer in
comparison. But we bribed the eunuchs and got them anyway. And we also
pleasured each other.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth studied her, not quite sure whether to believe it
all. &quot;I've heard the harems of the Turks in the Levant are said to be like
some sort of prison. Was it like that?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Not at all.&quot; She smiled easily. A bit too easily,
he thought. &quot;We used to take trips to the countryside, or even go with His
Majesty when he went to Kashmir in the hot summer. In a way we were freer than
the poor third wife of some stingy merchant.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But weren't you always under guard?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Of course. You know the word 'harem' is actually Arabic
for 'forbidden sanctuary.' Here we call it by the Persian name <i>zenana</i>,
but it's still the same. It's really a city of women. All cities must have
guards. But we each received a salary and were like government officials, with
our own servants. We each had our own apartment, immense and decorated with
paintings and bubbling fountains at the door. Except there were no doors, since
we were always supposed to be open to receive His Majesty.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Wasn't there anything about it you didn't like?&quot;
He examined her skeptically. &quot;It seems to me I could list a few
drawbacks.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;A few things. I didn't like the intrigues. All the
women</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>scheming how
to lure His Majesty to their apartment, and giving him aphrodisiacs to try to
prolong his time there. The beautiful ones were constantly afraid of being
poisoned, or spied on by the older women and the female slaves. And some of the
women were always trying to bribe eunuchs to bring in young men disguised as
serving-women.&quot; She took the stem of a flower and began to weave it
between his toes. &quot;But there are always intrigues anywhere. It's the price
we pay for life.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You've never told me how you came to be in the <i>zenana
</i>in the first place. Were you bought, the way women are in the Levant?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Kali burst into laughter. &quot;<i>Feringhis</i> can be such
simpletons sometimes. What wonderful legends must be told in this place called
Europe.&quot; Then she sobered. &quot;I was there because my mother was very
clever. The <i>zenana</i> is powerful, and she did everything she could to get
me there. She knew if His Majesty liked me, there could be a good post for my
father. She planned it for years. And when I finally reached fifteen she took
me to the annual mina bazaar that Arangbar always holds on the Persian New Year,
just like his father Akman did.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What's that?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It's a mock 'bazaar' held on the grounds of the palace,
and only women can go. Anyone who wants to be seen by His Majesty sets up a
stall, made of silk and gauze, and pretends to sell handiwork, things like lace
and perfume. But no woman can get in who isn't beautiful.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Was that where the Moghul first saw you?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Of course. Arangbar came to visit all the stalls,
riding around on a litter that some Tartar women from the <i>zenana </i>carried,
surrounded by his eunuchs. He would pretend to bargain for the handiwork,
calling the women pretty thieves, but he was really inspecting them, and the
daughters they'd brought. I was there with my mother, and I wore a thin silk
blouse because my breasts were lovely.&quot; She paused and looked at him
hopefully, brushing a red-tipped finger across one nipple. &quot;Don't you
think they still are? A little?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Everything about you is beautiful.&quot; It was all too
true. As</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>he looked at
her, he told himself he much preferred her now to how she must have looked at
fifteen.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, I suppose Arangbar must have thought so too,
because the next day he sent a broker to pay my mother to let me come to the <i>zenana</i>.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Hawksworth paused, then forced nonchalance into his
voice. &quot;Did Shirin, or her mother, do the same?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Of course not.&quot; Kali seemed appalled at the
absurdity of the idea. &quot;She's Persian. Her father was already some kind of
official. He was far too dignified to allow his women to go to the mina bazaar.
The Moghul must have seen her somewhere else. But if he wanted her, her father
could not refuse.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What eventually happened to you . . . and to her?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;She became his favorite.&quot; Kali took out her betel
leaf and tossed it aside. &quot;That's always very dangerous. She was in great
trouble after the queen came to Agra.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I've heard something about that.&quot; He found himself
wanting to hear a lot more about it, but he held back. &quot;And what happened
to you after you entered the <i>zenana</i>?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;His Majesty only came to me once, as was his
duty.&quot; She laughed but there was no mirth in her voice. &quot;Remember I
was only fifteen then. I knew nothing about lovemaking, though I tried very
hard to please him. But by that time he was already entranced with Shirin. He
began to call for her almost every afternoon.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;So what did you do after that?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I began to make love to the other women there. I
suppose it sounds strange to you, but I found I actually enjoyed other women's
bodies very much.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Weren't you ever lonely?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;A little. But I'm lonely here sometimes too.&quot; She
paused and looked away. &quot;A courtesan is always lonely. No man will ever
truly love her. He'll listen to her sing to him and joke with him, but his
heart will never be hers, regardless of all the sweet promises he'll think to
make her.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth watched her quickly mask the sadness in her eyes
as she reached for the hookah. At that moment he wanted more than anything in
the world to tell her it wasn't always true, but he knew she would hate the
lie. Instead he took out his own betel leaf and cleared his throat awkwardly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You've never told me how you came to be called Kali.
Mukarrab Khan said that's not your real name.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She looked at him and her eyes became ice. &quot;He's a truly
vicious man. What did he say?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That you would tell me.&quot; He paused, bewildered.
&quot;Don't you want to?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She wiped her eyes with a quick motion. &quot;Why not? You
may as well know. Before someone else tells you. But please try to understand I
was very lonely. You can't know how lonely it becomes in the <i>zenana</i>. How
you long for a man to touch you, just once. You can't imagine. After a while
you become . . . sort of mad. It becomes your obsession. Can you understand?
Even a little?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I've seen men at sea for months at a time. I could tell
you a few stories about that that might shock you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She laughed. &quot;Nothing, absolutely nothing, shocks me any
more. But now I'll shock you. There was this beautiful eunuch who guarded the <i>zenana</i>
at night. He was Abyssinian, very tall and striking, and he was named Abnus
because he was the color of ebony. He was truly exquisite.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;A eunuch?&quot; Hawksworth stared at her, disbelieving.
&quot;I always thought . . .&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She stopped him. &quot;I probably know what you always
thought. But eunuchs are not all the same. The Bengali eunuchs like Mukarrab
Khan has were sold by their parents when they were very young, and they've had
everything cut away with a razor. Muslim merchants buy boys in Bengal and take
them to Egypt, where Coptic monks specialize in the operation. That's the type
called <i>sandali</i>. They even have to pass water through a straw. But the
operation is so dangerous few of the boys live, so they're very expensive.
Abnus had been sent to His Majesty as a gift from some Arab merchant, who was
so stingy he simply crushed the testicles of one of his grown slaves instead of
buying a Bengali boy. No one realized Abnus could still do almost everything
any man can do. It was our secret.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;So you made love to a eunuch?&quot; Hawksworth found</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>himself
incredulous.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Kali smiled and nodded. &quot;Then one day our Kashmiri ward
servant entered my apartment unannounced. She had suspected us. I didn't know
until that moment she was a spy for the palace.&quot; She stopped and a small
shiver seemed to pass through her. &quot;We were both condemned to death. I
didn't care. I didn't want to live anyway. He was killed the next day, left on a
pike to die in the sun.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Kali paused and her lips quivered slightly. Then she
continued. &quot;I was buried up to the neck in the courtyard. To watch him
die. Then, in late afternoon some Imperial guards came and uncovered me. And
they took me back into the palace. I was delirious. They took me into this
room, and there she was.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Who?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Queen Janahara. She offered me a chance to live. I
didn't know what I was doing, where I was, anything. Before I thought I'd
already agreed.&quot; At last a tear came. &quot;And I've never told anyone.
I'm so ashamed.&quot; She wiped her eyes and stiffened. &quot;But I've never
done what I told her I would do. Not once.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What was that?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Kali looked at him and laughed. &quot;To come here with
Mukarrab Khan. And spy on Shirin. So now and then I just send some silly
nonsense to Her Majesty. I know what Shirin is doing . . . and I admire her for
it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth tried to keep his voice even. &quot;What exactly
is it she's doing?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Kali stopped abruptly and stared at him. &quot;That's the one
thing I can't tell you. But I will tell you that I'm now also supposed to be
spying on you too, for Khan Sahib.&quot; She laughed again. &quot;But you never
say anything for me to report.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth found himself stunned. Before he could speak, she
continued.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But you asked about my name. It's probably the real
reason I despise Janahara so much. Before, I was named Mira. My father was
Hakim Ali, and he came to India from Arabia back when Akman was Moghul. But the
queen said I could never use those names again. She said that because I'd caused
Abnus' death, she was renaming me Kali, the name the Hindus have for their
bloodthirsty goddess of death and destruction. She said it would remind me
always of what I'd done. I hate the name.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then I'll call you Mira.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She took his hand and brushed it against her cheek. &quot;It
doesn't matter now. Besides, I'll probably never see you again after tonight.
Tomorrow you'll be getting ready to leave for Agra. Khan Sahib told me I'm not
to come to you any more after this. I think he's very upset about something that
happened with your ships.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm very upset about it too.&quot; Hawksworth studied
her. &quot;What exactly did he say?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;No, I've told you enough already. Too much.&quot; She
pinched his toe. &quot;Now. You will keep your promise, my love. And then after
tonight you can forget me.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth was watching her, entranced. &quot;I'll never
forget you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She tried to smile. &quot;Oh yes you will. I know men better
than that. But I'll always remember you. When a man and a woman share their
bodies with each other, a bond is made between them. It's never entirely
forgotten, at least by me. So tonight, our last night, I want you to let me
give you something of mine to keep.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She reached under the couch and withdrew a box, teakwood and
trimmed in gold. She placed it on the velvet tapestry between them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I've never shown this to a <i>feringhi</i> before, but
I want you to have it. To make you remember me, at least for a while.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I've never had a present from an Indian woman
before.&quot; Hawksworth carefully opened the box's gold latch. Inside was a
book, bound in leather and gilded, with exquisite calligraphy on its cover.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It's called the Ananga-Ranga, the Pleasures of Women.
It was written over a hundred years ago by a Brahmin poet who called himself
Kalyana Mai. He wrote it in Sanskrit for his patron, the Viceroy of Gujarat,
the same province where you are now.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But why are you giving it to me?&quot; Hawksworth
looked into her eyes. &quot;I'll remember you without a book. I promise.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And I'll remember you. You've given me much pleasure.
But there are those in India who believe the union of man and woman should be
more than pleasure. The Hindus believe this union is an expression of all the
sacred forces of life. You know I'm not a Hindu. I'm a Muslim courtesan. So for
me lovemaking is only to give you pleasure. But I want you to know there's
still more, beyond what we've had together, beyond my skills and knowledge.
According to the Hindu teachings, the union of male and female is a way to
reach the divine nature. That's why I want you to have this book. It describes
the many different orders of women, and tells how to share pleasure with each.
It tells of many things beyond what I know.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She took the leatherbound copy of the Ananga-Ranga and opened
it to the first page. The calligraphy was bold and sensuous.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;In this book Kalyana Mai explains that there are four
orders of women. The three highest orders he calls the Lotus Woman, the Art
Woman, and the Conch Woman. The rest he dismisses as Elephant Women.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth took the book and examined its pages for a time. There
were many paintings, small colored miniatures of couples pleasuring one another
in postures that seemed astounding. Finally he mounted his courage.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Which 'order' of woman are you?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I think I must be the third order, the Conch Woman. The
book says that the Conch Woman delights in clothes, flowers, red ornaments.
That she is given to fits of amorous passion, which make her head and mind
confused, and at the moment of exquisite pleasure, she thrusts her nails into
the man's flesh. Have you ever noticed me do that?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth felt the scratches along his chest and smiled.
Only in India, he thought, could you make love so many ways, all kneeling
before a woman rather than lying with her. So she scratches you on the chest.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;So far it sounds a bit like you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And it says the Conch Woman's love cleft, what the</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Hindus call
her yoni, is always moist with <i>kama salila</i>, the woman's love seed. And
its taste is salt. Does that also remind you of me?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth was startled with wry delight when he realized he
actually knew the answer. Something he'd never had the slightest desire to know
about a woman in England.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>In England. Where baths were limited to the face, neck,
hands, and feet—and those only once every few weeks. Where women wore unwashed
petticoats and stays until they literally fell off. Where a member of the
peerage was recently quoted as complaining &quot;the nobler parts are never in
this island washed by the women; they are left to be lathered by the men.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But Kali was scrubbed and perfumed each day like a flower.
And she had taught him the pleasure in the taste of all her body.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I guess that makes you a Conch Woman. But what are the
others supposed to be like?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Let me tell you what it says.&quot; She reached and
took back the book. &quot;The next one, the Art Woman, has a voice like a
peacock, and she delights in singing and poetry. Her carnal desire may be less
strong than the Conch Woman, at least until she's properly aroused, but then
her <i>kama salila </i>is hot, with a perfume like honey. And it's abundant,
producing a sound with the act of union. She is sensuous, but for her
lovemaking is always a kind of art.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Who would be an Art Woman?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She looked at him and smiled wryly. &quot;I think Shirin, the
one who fascinates you so much, may well be an Art Woman. But I don't know her
body well.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>But I will, Hawksworth told himself. I'll know all
of her. Somehow. I swear it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And what about the Lotus Woman?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;According to Kalyana Mai she's actually the highest
order of woman. She's a spiritual being, who loves to converse with teachers
and Hindu priests. She's always very beautiful, never dark, and her breasts are
full and high. Her <i>yoni </i>is like an opening lotus bud and her <i>kama
salila </i>is perfumed like a lily newly burst.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And who would be a Lotus Woman?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;The only one I've ever known for sure is in
Agra now. She's a classical dancer, a Hindu temple dancer. Her name is
Kamala.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I saw a few dancers recently. At the Shahbandar's
estate house. In my <i>feringhi</i> opinion they weren't of a very high
order.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Those were <i>nautch</i> girls, common whores. They
degrade and debase the classical dance of India for the purpose of enticing
customers. Kamala is nothing like them. She's a great artist. For her the
dance, and lovemaking, are a kind of worship of the Hindu gods. I don't
entirely understand it, but I could sense her power the one time I saw her
dance. When I saw her I began to believe what people say, that she embodies the
female principle, the divine female principle that defines India for the Hindu
people. Believe me when I tell you she's very different from anyone here in
Surat. She knows things that no one else knows. People say they're explained in
a very old book she has.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;How can there possibly be any more to know?&quot;
Hawksworth thought of the hundreds of pleasure tricks Kali had taught him,
delights unknown in Europe. &quot;What's left to put in this other book?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Her book is one I've never actually seen. I've only
heard about it. It's a sacred text of the Hindus', an ancient sutra, in which
the union of man and woman are shown to be a way of finding your own divine
natures, the God within you both. I'm told it's called the Kama Sutra, the
Scripture of Love and Pleasure.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth found himself beginning to be overwhelmed.
&quot;Maybe we'd better start with this book. What exactly does it say?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The Ananga-Ranga explains that each order of woman must
be aroused, must be awakened to her pleasure, in a different way. At different
times of day, with different caresses, different kinds of kisses and scratches
and bites, different words, different embraces during union. It says if you
learn to know women well, you will understand how to give and receive the
greatest enjoyment with each.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Is it really so complicated?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Now you're starting to sound like some Muslim men I
know, who lock their women away and make love to boys, claiming women are
insatiable. With desires ten times stronger than those of a man. But they're
actually afraid of a woman, so they believe she's to be enjoyed quickly and as
little as possible. They care nothing for her own pleasure. But a woman must be
aroused to enjoy union to its fullest. That's why this book is so important. I
happen to think you are one who cares about a woman's pleasure.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth stroked her smooth leg mischievously, then took
the book and gently laid it aside. &quot;Tell me what it says about a Conch
Woman. What have I been doing that's right and wrong?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The book says that the Conch Woman prefers union with a
man in the third <i>pahar</i> of the night.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;When is that?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Time is counted in India by <i>pahar</i>. The day and
the night are each divided into four <i>pahars</i>. The first <i>pahar </i>of
the night would be between six and nine in the evening by <i>feringhi </i>time.
The third <i>pahar </i>would be your hours between midnight and three in the
morning. Is that not the very time I come to your couch?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That's convenient.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It also says that on certain days of the moon, which it
tells, the Conch Woman particularly enjoys having her body pressed with the
nails of the man. Some days roughly, some days gently. And on certain days the
embrace must be forceful, on certain days gentle. There are many special ways
to touch and embrace a Conch Woman, and they are explained here. Also there are
certain ways of kissing her, of biting her, of scratching her. For example, you
may kiss her upper lip, or her lower lip, or you may kiss her with your tongue
only.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And how am I supposed to be able to kiss you with my
tongue only?&quot; Hawksworth cast a skeptical glance at the book.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It's very easy.&quot; She smiled at him slyly.
&quot;Perhaps it's easier if I show you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She took his lower lip gently with the tips of her fingers,
passed her tongue over it slowly and languorously, and then suddenly nipped it
playfully. He started in surprise.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;There. You see there are many ways to please a woman,
to kiss her, to bite her, to scratch her. When you have become a true lover of
women, my strong <i>feringhi</i>, you will know them all.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth shifted uncomfortably. &quot;What next?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The book also tells of the bodies of women. Foolish men
often do not know these things, my love, but I think you are beginning to
learn. It tells that in the upper cleft of the <i>yoni </i>there's a small
organ it likens to a plantain-shoot sprouting from the ground. This is the seat
of pleasure in a woman, and when it is excited, her<i> kama salila </i>flows in
profusion.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;And then?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;When the woman is ready, you may both enjoy the act of
union to its fullest. And there are many, many ways this may be done. The book
tells of thirty-two. It is the great wisdom of Kalyana Mai that a woman must
have variety in her love couch. If she does not find this with one man, she
will seek others. It is the same with men, I think.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth nodded noncommittally, not wishing to appear
overly enthusiastic.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Finally, he tells the importance of a woman reaching
her moment of enjoyment. If she does not, she will be unsatisfied and may seek
pleasure elsewhere. In India, a woman is taught to signify this moment by the <i>sitkrita</i>,
the drawing in of breath between the closed teeth. There are many different
ways a woman may do this, but you will know, my love.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Enough of the book.&quot; He took it and replaced it in
the box. &quot;Somehow I think I've already had a lot of its lessons.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That was merely my duty to you. To be a new woman for
you each night. And I think you've learned well.&quot; She took the box and
settled it beside the couch. Then she laughed lightly. &quot;But you still have
a few things to learn. Tonight, for our last time together, I will show you the
most erotic embrace I know.&quot; She examined him with her half-closed eyes,
and drew one last burst of smoke from the hookah. Then she carefully positioned
the large velvet bolster in the center of the couch. &quot;Are you capable of
it?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Try me.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Very well. But I must be deeply aroused to enjoy this
fully. Come and let me show you all the places you must bite.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The sun was directly overhead when Vasant Rao reined his
iron-gray stallion to a halt at the Abidjan Gate. Behind him, beyond the grove
of mango and tamarind trees, lay the stone reservoir of Surat. It was almost a
mile in circumference, and he had chosen its far bank as campground for his
Rajput guard. Accommodations in Surat were nonexistent during the season, and
although he could have cleared a guest house with a single name, Prince Jadar,
he had chosen to remain inconspicuous.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Through the dark bamboo slats of the gate he could now see
the Englishman riding toward him, holding his Arabian mare at an easy pace.
Vasant Rao studied the gait carefully. He had learned he could always judge the
character of a man by observing that man's handling of a mount. He casually
stroked his moustache and judged Brian Hawksworth.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The Englishman is unpracticed, yet there's an unmistakable
sense of command about him. Not unlike the control the prince holds over a
horse. He handles the mare almost without her knowing it, forcing discipline
onto her natural gait. Perhaps our treacherous friend Mirza Nuruddin was right.
Perhaps the Englishman will suit our requirements.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Vasant Rao remembered that Jadar had been insistent on the
point.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The English captain must be a man of character and
nerve, or he must never reach Burhanpur. You need only be seen providing his
guard as you depart Surat. If he's weak, like a Christian, he will not serve
our needs.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The times ahead will be difficult enough, Vasant Rao told
himself, without having to worry about the Englishman. The prince has been
trapped in the south, and now there's news Inayat Latif and his troops are
being recalled to Agra from Bengal. The queen will soon have at her right hand
the most able general in the Moghul’s army.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Vasant Rao turned his eyes from the Englishman to look again
at his own Rajput guard, and his pride in them restored his spirit. Only
Rajputs would have the courage to one day face the numerically superior troops
of Inayat Latif.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The origin of the warrior clans who called themselves
Rajputs, &quot;sons of kings,&quot; was lost in legend. They had appeared
mysteriously in western India over half a millennium before the arrival of the
Moghuls, and they had royalty, and honor, in their blood. They had always
demanded to be known as Kshatriya, the ancient Hindu warrior caste.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The men, and women, of the warrior Kshatriya clans lived and
died by the sword, and maintained a timeless tradition of personal honor.
Theirs was a profession of arms, and they lived by rules of conduct unvaried
since India's epic age. A member of the warrior caste must never turn his back
in battle, must never strike with concealed weapons. No warrior could strike a
foe who was fleeing, who asked for mercy, whose own sword was broken, who
slept, who had lost his armor, who was merely an onlooker, who was facing
another foe. Surrender was unthinkable. A Rajput defeated in battle need not
return home, since his wife would turn him out in dishonor for not having given
his life. But if a Rajput perished with a sword in his hand, the highest honor,
his wife would proudly follow him in death, joining his body on the funeral
pyre. And many times, in centuries past, Rajput women themselves had taken up
swords to defend the honor of their clain.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>When they had no external foes, the Rajput clans warred among
themselves, since they knew no other life. For convenience, each clan decreed
its immediate neighboring clans its enemies, and an elaborate code was devised
to justify war over even the smallest slight. Their martial skills were never
allowed to gather rust, even if the cost was perpetual slaughter of each other.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Though they were divided among themselves, the Rajput clans
had for centuries defended their lands from the Muslim invaders of India. Only
with the coming of the great Moghul genius Akman was there a Muslim ruler with
the wisdom to understand the Rajputs could be more valuable as allies than as
foes. He abandoned attempts to subdue them, instead making them partners in his
empire. He married Rajput princesses; and he used Rajput fighting prowess to
extend Moghul control south and west in India.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The men with Vasant Rao were the elite of the dominant
Chauhan clan, and all claimed descent from royal blood. They held strong
loyalties, powerful beliefs, and absolutely no fear of what lay beyond death.
They also were men from the northwest mountains of India, who had never before
seen Surat, never before seen the sea, never before seen a <i>feringhi</i>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But Vasant Rao had seen <i>feringhi</i>, when he had stood by
the side of Prince Jadar in Agra, when Jesuit fathers had been called to
dispute with Muslim mullahs before Arangbar. He had seen their tight, assured
faces, and heard their narrow, intolerant views. Could this <i>feringhi </i>be
any different?</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Already he had witnessed the Englishman's nerve, and
it had reminded him, curiously, of Jadar. The Englishman had refused to come to
their camp, claiming this demeaned his office of ambassador. And Vasant Rao,
representative of Prince Jadar, had refused to meet the Englishman inside
Surat. Finally it was agreed that they would meet at the wall of the city, at
the Abidjan Gate.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Nimaste, Ambassador Hawksworth. His Highness, Prince
Jadar, conveys his most respectful greetings to you and to the English
king.&quot; Vasant Rao's Turki had been excellent since his boyhood, and he
tried to remember the phrases Mirza Nuruddin had coached. Then he watched
through the bamboo poles of the gate as Hawksworth performed a lordly salaam
from horseback.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The gate opened.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I am pleased to offer my good offices to you and your
king,&quot; Vasant Rao continued, &quot;in the name of His Highness, the
prince. It is his pleasure, and my honor, to provide you escort for your
journey east to Burhanpur. From there His Highness will arrange a further
escort for the trip north to Agra.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;His Majesty, King James, is honored by His Highness'
concern.&quot; Hawksworth examined the waiting Rajputs, his apprehension
mounting. Their eyes were expressionless beneath their leather helmets, but
their horses pawed impatiently. He found himself wondering if Mirza Nuruddin
had contrived to provide more &quot;help,&quot; and yet another surprise.
&quot;But my route is not yet decided. Although I'm grateful for His Highness'
offer, I'm not certain traveling east on the Burhanpur road is best. His
Excellency, Mukarrab Khan, has offered to provide an escort if I take the
Udaipur road, north past Cambay and then east.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Vasant Rao examined Hawksworth, choosing his words carefully.
&quot;We have orders to remain here for three days, Captain, and then to return
to Burhanpur. It would be considered appropriate by the prince, who has full
authority to administer this province, if we rode escort for you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth shifted in the saddle.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>This isn't an offer. It's an ultimatum.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Is His Highness aware I have with me a large sea chest?
It will require a cart, which I plan to hire. Perhaps the delay this will
impose would inconvenience you and your men, since you surely prefer to ride
swiftly.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;On the contrary, Captain. We will have with us a small
convoy of supplies, lead for molding shot. We will travel at a pace that best
suits us all. Your chest presents no difficulty.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But there will be many difficulties, he told himself. And he
thought again about Mirza Nuruddin and the terms he had demanded. Twenty
percent interest on the loan, and only a hundred and eighty days to repay both
the new silver coin and the interest.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But why, Vasant Rao asked himself again, did the Shahbandar
agree to the plan at all? Is this Mirza Nuruddin's final wager? That Jadar will
win?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Will three days be sufficient for your preparations,
Captain Hawksworth?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It will. If I decide to use the Burhanpur road.&quot;
Hawksworth wondered how long he could taunt the Raput.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Perhaps I should tell you something about travel in
India, Ambassador. There are, as you say, two possible routes between Surat and
Agra. Both present certain risks. The northern route, through Udaipur and
Rajputana, is at first appearance faster, since the roads are drier and the
rivers there have already subsided from the monsoon. But it is not a part of India
where travelers are always welcomed by the local Rajput clans. You may well
find yourself in the middle of a local war, or the reluctant guest of a petty
raja who judges you worth a ransom.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;On the other hand, if you travel east, through
Burhanpur, you may find that some rivers are still heavy from the monsoon, at
least for another month. But the clans there are loyal to Prince Jadar, and
only near Chopda, halfway to Burhanpur, will you encounter any local brigands.
Theirs, however, is an honorable profession, and they are always willing to
accept bribes in return for safe passage. We ordinarily do not kill them,
though we easily could, since petty robbery—they view it as a toll—is their
livelihood and their tradition. They are weak and they make weak demands. Such
is not true of the rajas in Rajputana. The choice is yours, but if you value
your goods, and your life, you will join us as we make our way east to
Burhanpur.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth studied the bearded Rajput guards as Vasant Rao
spoke.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I'm either a captive of the prince or of Mukarrab Khan,
regardless of what I do. Which one wants me dead more?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;My frigate sails tomorrow. I can leave the following
day.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Good, it's agreed then. Our convoy will leave in three
days. It will be my pleasure to travel with you, Captain Hawksworth. Your
reputation has already reached His Highness. We will meet you here at the
beginning of the second <i>pahar</i>. I believe that's your hour of nine in the
morning.&quot; He smiled with a warmth that was almost genuine. &quot;You
should consider yourself fortunate. Few <i>feringhi</i> have ever traveled
inland. You will find the interior far different from Surat. Until then.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He bowed lightly and snapped a command to the waiting
horsemen. In moments they were lost among the trees.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;This evening must be a time of farewell for us both,
Captain Hawksworth. You know, the Hindus believe life and death are an endless
cycle that dooms them to repeat their miserable existence over and over again.
I myself prefer to think that this one life is itself cyclical, ever renewing.
What was new, exciting, yesterday is today tedious and tiresome. So tomorrow
brings us both rebirth. For you it is Agra, for me Goa. But I expect to see
Surat again, as no doubt do you. Who knows when our paths will cross once
more?&quot; Mukarrab Khan watched as a eunuch shoved wide the door leading onto
the torchlit garden. &quot;You have been a most gracious visitor, tolerating
with exemplary forbearance my unworthy hospitality. Tonight perhaps you will
endure one last evening of my company, even if I have little else left to
offer.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The courtyard was a confused jumble of packing cases and
household goods. Servants were everywhere, wrapping and crating rolled carpets,
bolsters, furniture, vases, and women's clothing. Elephants stood near the back
of the courtyard, howdahs on their backs, waiting to be loaded. Goods would be
transferred to barks for the trip downriver to the bar, where they would be
loaded aboard a waiting Portuguese frigate.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;My dining hall has been dismantled, its carpet rolled.
We have no choice but to dine this evening in the open air, like soldiers on
the march.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth was no longer hearing Mukarrab Khan. He was
staring past him, through the smoke, not quite believing what he saw. But it
was all too real. Standing in the corner of the courtyard were two Europeans in
black cassocks. Portuguese Jesuits.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Mukarrab Khan noticed Hawksworth's diplomatic smile suddenly
freeze on his face, and turned to follow his gaze.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Ah, I must introduce you. You do understand the
Portuguese language, Captain?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Enough.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I should have thought so. I personally find it
abominable and refuse to study it. But both the fathers here have studied
Persian in Goa, and I think one of them knows a bit of Turki, from his time in
Agra.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What are they doing here?&quot; Hawksworth tried to
maintain his composure.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;They returned to Surat just today from Goa, where
they've been these past few weeks. I understand they're en route to the Jesuit
mission in Lahore, a city in the Punjab, well to the north of Agra. They
specifically asked to meet you.&quot; He laughed. &quot;They're carrying no
cannon, Captain, and I assumed you had no objection.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You assumed wrong. I have nothing to say to a
Jesuit.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You'll meet Jesuits enough in Agra, Captain, at the
Moghul’s court. Consider this evening a foretaste.&quot; Mukarrab Khan tried to
smile politely, but there was a strained look in his eyes and he fingered his
jeweled ring uncomfortably. &quot;You would favor me by speaking to them.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The two Europeans were now moving toward them, working their
way through the swarm of servants and crates in the courtyard. The ruby-studded
crucifixes they wore against their black cassocks seemed to shoot red sparks
into the evening air. Mukarrab Khan urged Hawksworth forward apprehensively.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;May I have the pleasure to present Ambassador Brian
Hawksworth, who represents His Majesty, King James of England, and is also, I
believe, an official of England's East India Company.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And to you, Ambassador, I have the honor to introduce
Father Alvarez Sarmento, Superior for the Society of Jesus' mission in Lahore,
and Father Francisco da Silva.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth nodded lightly and examined them. Although
Sarmento was aged, his face remained strong and purposeful, with hard cheeks
and eyes that might burn through marble. The younger priest could not have been
more different. His ruddy neck bulged from the tight collar of his cassock, and
his eyes shifted uncomfortably behind his puffed cheeks. Hawksworth wondered
absently how long his bloat—too much capon and port wine—would last if Mackintosh
had him on the third watch for a month.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You are a celebrated man, Captain Hawksworth.&quot;
Father Sarmento spoke in flawless Turki, but his voice was like ice.
&quot;There is much talk of you in Goa. The new Viceroy himself requested that
we meet you, and convey a message.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;His last message was to order an unlawful attack on my
merchantmen. I think he still remembers my reply. Is he now offering to abide
by the treaty your Spanish king signed with King James?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That treaty has no force in Asia, Captain. His Excellency
has asked us to inform you that your mission to Agra will not succeed. Our
fathers have already informed the Moghul that England is a lawless nation
living outside the grace of the Church. Perhaps you are unaware of the esteem
he now holds for our Agra mission. We have a church there now, and through it
we have led many carnal-minded Moors to God. We have refuted the Islamic
mullahs in His Majesty's very presence, and shown him the falsity of their
Prophet and his laws. Indeed, it is only because of the esteem we have earned
that he now sends an ambassador to the Portuguese Viceroy.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Before Hawksworth could respond, Father Sarmento suddenly
reached out and touched his arm imploringly. &quot;Captain, let me speak now
not for the Viceroy, but for the Holy Church.&quot; Hawksworth realized with a
shock that he was speaking English. &quot;Do you understand the importance of
God's work in this sea of damned souls? For decades we have toiled in this
vineyard, teaching the Grace of God and His Holy Church, and now at last our
prayers are near to answer. When Arangbar became Moghul, our Third Mission had
already been here for ten long, fruitless years. We strove to teach the Grace
of God to his father, Akman, but his damnation was he could never accept a
single True Church. He would harken to a heathen fakir as readily as to a
disciple of God. At first Arangbar seemed like him, save his failing was not
ecumenicity. It was indifference, and suspicion. Now, after years of ignominy,
we have secured his trust. And with that trust will soon come his soul.&quot;
Sarmento paused to cross himself. &quot;When at last a Christian holds the
throne of India, there will be rejoicing at the Throne of Heaven. You may
choose to live outside the Mystery of the Most Holy Sacrament, my son, but
surely you would not wish to undo God's great work. I implore you not to go
before the Moghul now, not to sow unrest in his believing mind with stories of
the quarrels and hatreds of Europe. England was once in the bosom of the Holy
Church, until your heretic King Henry; and England had returned again, before
your last, heretic queen led you once more to damnation. Know the Church always
stands with open heart to receive you, or any apostate Lutheran, who wishes to
repent and save his immortal soul.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I see now why Jesuits are made diplomats. Is your
concern the loss of the Moghul’s soul, or the loss of his trade revenues in
Goa?&quot; Hawksworth deliberately answered in Turki. &quot;Tell your pope to
stop trying to meddle in England's politics, and tell your Viceroy to honor our
treaty and there'll be no 'quarrels' between us here.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Will you believe my word, sworn before God, that I have
told His Excellency that very thing? That this new war could destroy our years
of work and prayer.&quot; Sarmento still spoke in English. &quot;But he is a
man with a personal vendetta toward the English. It is our great tragedy. The
Viceroy of Goa, His Excellency, Miguel Vaijantes, is a man nourished by hatred.
May God forgive him.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth stood speechless as Father Sarmento crossed
himself.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What did you say his name was?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Miguel Vaijantes. He was in Goa as a young captain, and
now he has returned as Viceroy. We must endure him for three more years. The
Antichrist himself could not have made our cup more bitter, could not have
given us a greater test of our Christian love. Do you understand now why I beg
you in God's name to halt this war between us?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth felt suddenly numb. He stumbled past the aged
priest and blindly stared into the torchlit courtyard, trying to remember
precisely what Roger Symmes had said that day so many years ago in the offices
of the Levant Company. One of the few things he had never forgotten from
Symmes's monologue of hallucinations and dreams was the name Miguel Vaijantes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth slowly turned to face Father Sarmento and switched
to English.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I will promise you this, Father. If I reach Agra, I
will</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>never speak
of popery unless asked. It honestly doesn't interest me. I'm here on a mission,
not a crusade. And in return I would ask one favor of you. I would like you to
send a message to Miguel Vaijantes. Tell him that twenty years ago in Goa he
once ordered the death of an English captain named Hawksworth on the <i>strappado</i>.
Tell him . . .&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The crash of shattering glass from the hallway of the palace
severed the air between them. Then the heavy bronze door swung wide and Shirin
emerged, grasping the broken base of a Chinese vase. Her eyes blazed and her
disheveled hair streamed out behind her. Hawksworth thought he saw a stain on
one cheek where a tear had trailed, but now that trail was dry. She strode
directly to Mukarrab Khan and dashed the remainder of the vase at his feet,
where it shattered to powder on the marble tiles of the veranda.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That is my gift to the queen. You may send it with a
message in your next dispatch. Tell her that I too am Persian, that I too know
the name of my father's father, of his father's father, of his father's father,
for ten generations. But unlike her, I was born in India. And it is in India
that I will stay. She can banish me to the remotest village of the Punjab, but
she will never send me to Goa. To live among unwashed Portuguese. Never. She
does not have the power. And if you were a man, you would divorce me. Here.
Tonight. For all to see. And I will return to my father, or go where I wish. Or
you may kill me, as you have already tried to do. But you must decide.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Mukarrab Khan's face was lost in shock. The courtyard stood
lifeless, caught in a silence more powerful than any Hawksworth had ever known.
He looked in confusion at Father Sarmento, and the old Jesuit quietly whispered
a translation of the Persian, his own eyes wide in disbelief. Never before had
he seen a Muslim woman defy her husband publicly. The humiliation was
unthinkable. Mukarrab Khan had no power to order her death. He had no choice
but to divorce her as she demanded. But everyone knew why she was his wife.
What would a divorce mean?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You will proceed to Goa as my wife, or you will spend
the rest of your days, and what little remains of your fading beauty, as a <i>nautch</i>
girl at the port. Your price will be one copper <i>pice</i>. I will order it in
the morning.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;His Majesty will know of it within a week. I have
friends enough in Agra.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;As do I. And mine have the power to act.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then divorce me.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Mukarrab Khan paused painfully, then glanced down and
absently whisked a fleck of lint from his brocade sleeve. &quot;Which form do
you wish?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>An audible gasp passed through the servants, and not one
breathed as they waited for the answer. There were three forms of divorce for
Muslims. The first, called a revocable divorce, was performed when a man said
&quot;I have divorced you&quot; only once. He had three months to reconsider
and reconcile before it became final. The second form, called irrevocable,
required the phrase be repeated twice, after which she could only become his
wife again through a second marriage ceremony. The third, absolute, required
three repetitions of the phrase and became effective the day her next
reproductive cycle ended. There could be no remarriage unless she had, in the
interim, been married to another.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Absolute.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Do you 'insist’?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I do.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then by law you must return the entire marriage
settlement.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You took it from me and squandered it long ago on <i>affion</i>
and pretty boys. What is left to return?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then it is done.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth watched in disbelief as Mukarrab Khan repeated
three times the Arabic phrase from the Quran that cast her out. The two Jesuits
also stood silently, their faces horrified.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Shirin listened impassively as his voice echoed across the
stunned courtyard. Then without a word she ripped the strands of pearls from
her neck and threw them at his feet. Before Mukarrab Khan could speak again,
she had turned and disappeared through the doorway of the palace.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;In the eyes of God, Excellency, you will always be man
and wife,&quot; Father Sarmento broke the silence. &quot;What He has joined,
man cannot rend.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>A look of great weariness seemed to flood Mukarrab Khan's
face as he groped to find the facade of calm that protected him. Then, with an
almost visible act of will, it came again.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Perhaps you understand now, Father, why the Prophet's
laws grant us more than one wife. Allah allows for certain . . .
mistakes.&quot; He forced a smile, then whirled on a wide-eyed eunuch.
&quot;Will the packing be finished by morning?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;As ordered, Khan Sahib.&quot; The eunuch snapped to
formality.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then see dinner is served my guests, or put my kitchen <i>wallahs</i>
to the lash.&quot; He turned back to Hawksworth. &quot;I'm told you met her
once, Ambassador. I trust she was more pleasant then.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Merely by accident, Excellency. While I was at the . .
. in the garden.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;She does very little by accident. You should mark her
well.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Your counsel is always welcome, Excellency.&quot;
Hawksworth felt his pulse surge. &quot;What will she do now?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I think she will have all her wishes granted.&quot; He
turned wearily toward the marble columns of the veranda. &quot;You will forgive
me if I must leave you now for a while. You understand I have further
dispatches to prepare.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He turned and was gone. After a moment's pause, the
despairing Jesuits trailed after.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>And suddenly the courtyard seemed empty.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The waves curled gently against the shore, breaking
iridescent over the staves of a half-buried keg. Before him the sea spread wide
and empty. Only a single sail broke the horizon. His mare pawed impatiently,
but Hawksworth could not bring himself to turn her back toward the road. Not
yet. Only when the sail's white had blended with the sea did he rein her around
and, with one last glance at the empty blue, give her the spur.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He rode briskly past the nodding palms along the shore, then
turned inland toward Surat, through villages of thatch- roofed houses on low
stilts. Women watched from the wide porches, sewing, nursing infants. After a
time he no longer saw them, no longer urged the mare. His thoughts were filled
with images from the tumultuous evening past.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He had paced the vacant rooms of the palace till the early
hours of morning, his mind in turmoil. Sleep was never a possibility. When the
courtyard at last grew still, he had slipped back into the garden, wanting its
openness, the feel of its order. In the moonlight it lay deserted, and as he
strolled alongside the bubbling fountain, he felt himself even more lost in
this alien place, this alien land. The pilot Karim had been right. India had
already unsettled him more than he thought he could bear.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>In time he found himself wandering once more through the
orchard, amid the wistful calls of night birds. The trees formed a roof of
leafy shadows, cold and joyless as the moon above. Even then, all he could see
was Shirin, poised defiant in the stark torchlight, taunting the queen. She had
offered herself up to almost certain death, for reasons he scarcely
comprehended.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Before he fully realized where he was, he looked up and saw
the observatory. A tiny blinking owl perched atop the staircase, studying him
critically as he approached. Around him the marble instruments glistened like
silver, while ahead stood the stone hut, forlorn now, more ramshackle than he
had ever remembered, more abandoned. He reflected sadly that it probably would
soon be forgotten entirely. Who would ever come here again?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The door of the hut was sealed tightly and for a time he
stood simply looking at it, trying to recall all that had passed inside.
Finally he reached with a determined hand and pulled it wide.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Shirin stared up from the table in shock, grabbing the lamp
as though to extinguish it. Then she recognized him in the flickering light.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Why . . . why are you here?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Before he could answer, she moved in front of the table,
masking it from his view. &quot;You should not have come. If you're seen . .
.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As his own surprise passed, he felt himself suddenly wanting
to take her in his arms. &quot;What does it matter now? You're divorced.&quot;
The words filled him with momentary exhilaration, till he remembered the rest.
&quot;You're also in danger, whether I'm seen or not.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That's my concern.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What are you planning to do?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Leave. But I still have friends.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He reached out and took the lamp from her, to feel the touch
of her hand. It was soft and warm. &quot;Will I ever see you again?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Who knows what will happen now?&quot; The wildness in
her eyes was beginning to gentle. She moved back from the table and dropped
into a chair. He realized it was the same chair she had sat in when telling him
about the queen. On the table before her were piles of papers, tied into small,
neat bundles. She examined him for a few moments in silence, then reached to
brush the hair back from her eyes. &quot;Did you come here just to see
me?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Not really . . .&quot; He stopped, then laughed.
&quot;I think maybe I did. I think I somehow knew you would be here, without
realizing I knew. I've been thinking about you all night.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Why?&quot; Her voice quickened just enough for him to
notice.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm not sure. I do know I'm very worried about what may
happen to you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;No one else seems to be. No one will talk to me now,
not even the servants. Suddenly I don't exist.&quot; Her eyes softened.
&quot;Thank you. Thank you for coming. It means you're not afraid. I'm
glad.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Why do you care whether I came or not?&quot; He asked
almost before realizing what he was saying.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She hesitated, and unconsciously ran her glance down his
frame. &quot;To see you one more time.&quot; He thought he saw something enter
her eyes, rising up unbidden. &quot;Don't you realize you've become very
special for me?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Tell me.&quot; He studied her eyes in the lamplight,
watching them soften even more.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You're not like anyone I've ever known. You're part of
something that's very strange to me. I sometimes find myself dreaming of you.
You're . . . you're very powerful. Something about you.&quot; She caught
herself, then laughed. &quot;But maybe it's not really you I dream about at
all. Maybe it's what you are.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What do you mean?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You're a man, from the West. There's a strength about
you I can't fully understand.&quot; He watched her holding herself in check.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Go on.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Maybe it's partly the way you touch and master the
things around you.&quot; She looked at him directly. &quot;Let me try to
explain what I mean. For most people in India, the world that matters most is
the world within. We explore the seas inside our own mind. And so we wait, we
wait for the world outside to be brought to us. But for you the inner world
seems secondary.&quot; She laughed again, and now her voice was controlled and
even. &quot;Perhaps I'm not explaining it well. Let me try again. Do you
remember the first thing you did on your very first morning in the
palace?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I walked out here, to the observatory.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But why did you?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Because I'm a seaman, and I thought . . .&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;No, that's only partly the reason.&quot; She smiled.
&quot;I think you came to see it because it belongs to the world of things.
Like a good European, you felt you must first and always be the master of
things. Of ships, of guns, even of the stars. Maybe that's why I find you so
strong.&quot; She paused, then reached out and touched his hand. The gesture had
been impulsive, and when she realized what she'd done, she moved to pull it
back, then stopped herself.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He looked at her in the lamplight, then gently placed his
other hand over hers and held it firm. &quot;Then let me tell you something. I
find you just as hard to understand. I find myself drawn to something about
you, and it troubles me.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Why should it trouble you?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Because I don't know who you are. What you are. Even
what you're doing, or why. You've risked everything for principles that are
completely outside me.&quot; He looked into her eyes, trying to find words.
&quot;And regardless of what you say, I think you somehow know everything there
is to know about me. I don't even have to tell you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Things pass between a man and woman that go beyond
words. Not everything has to be said.&quot; She shifted her gaze away.
&quot;You've had great sadness in your life. And I think it's killed some part
of you. You no longer allow yourself to trust or to love.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I've had some bad experiences with trust.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But don't let it die.&quot; Her eyes met his.
&quot;It's the thing most worthwhile.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He looked at her a long moment, feeling the tenderness
beneath her strength, and he knew he wanted her more than anything. Before he
thought, he had slipped his arm around her waist and drawn her up to him. He
later remembered his amazement at her softness, her warmth as he pulled her
body against his own. Before she could speak, he had kissed her, bringing her
mouth full to his lips. He had thought for an instant she would resist, and he
meant to draw her closer. Only then did he realize it was she who had come to
him, pressing her body against his. They clung together in the lamplight,
neither wanting the moment to end. At last, with an act of will, she pulled
herself away.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;No.&quot; Her breath was coming almost faster than his
own. &quot;It's impossible.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Nothing's impossible.&quot; He suddenly knew, with an
absolute certainty, that he had to make her his own. &quot;Come with me to
Agra. Together . . .&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Don't say it.&quot; She stopped his lips with her
finger. &quot;Not yet.&quot; She glanced at the papers on the table, then
reached for his hand, bringing it to her moist cheek. &quot;Not yet.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You're leaving. So am I. We'll leave together.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I can't.&quot; She was slipping from him. He felt it.
&quot;I'll think of you when you're in Agra. And when we're ready, we'll find
each other, I promise it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Before he knew, she had turned and gathered the bundles. When
she reached for the lamp, suddenly her hand stopped.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Let's leave it.&quot; She looked toward him.
&quot;Still burning.&quot; Then she reached out and brushed his lips with her
fingertips one last time. He watched in dismay as she passed on through the
doorway. In moments she was lost among the shadows of the orchard.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>       East
along the Tapti River valley the land was a verdant paradise, a patchwork of
mango and pipal groves and freshly turned dark earth. By mid-October the fields
of cotton, corn, and sugarcane were in harvest; and in the lowlands paired
buffalo strained to turn the crusted mud to readiness for broadcast sowing the
grain crops of autumn: millet, wheat, and barley. The monsoon-washed roads had
again grown passable, and now they were a continual procession, as mile-long
caravans of corn-laden bullock carts inched ponderously west toward the
shipping port of Surat.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The distance from Surat to Burhanpur was one hundred and
fifty <i>kos</i>, and in dry weather it could be traversed in just over a
fortnight. Vasant Rao had hired fifty carts to transport the sealed
bundles—which he said were lead—to Burhanpur, swelling his entourage of forty
Raput horsemen by fifty low-caste drivers and bullock teams. He had also hired
five additional carts to carry provisions.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Brian Hawksworth had contracted for his own cart and driver,
negotiating a price of twenty rupees for cartage of his belongings all the way
from Surat to Agra. He was amused to reflect that the chest containing King
James's gifts for the Moghul of India traveled lashed to the bed of a
ramshackle, wooden-wheeled cart originally intended for hay.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The caravan had been scheduled to depart early on a Saturday
morning, but the drivers had suddenly refused to budge until the following day.
Hawksworth had confronted his driver, Nayka, a dark-skinned low-caste man with
the spindly limbs of the underfed, and demanded to know why. Nayka had twisted
his head deferentially, riveting his eyes on the ground, and explained in
halting Turki.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Today is Saturday, Captain Sahib. Saturdays and</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Tuesdays are
sacred to the goddess Devi, the Divine Mother. Journeys begun on those days
always meet disaster. Bandits, tigers, washed-out roads. A Mussalman once made
my cousin bring a cart of indigo to Surat from a village down the river on a
Tuesday, and a bridge broke under his load. Both of his bullocks were
drowned.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It was mid-afternoon on Sunday when the caravan finally
pulled out from the water tank at Surat's Abidjan Gate. By nightfall they had
traveled three <i>kos</i>, reaching the outskirts of the village of Cossaria.
The next day they made twelve <i>kos</i> east-northeast to reach the town of
Karod, a strategic fort on the Tapti, dominated by a hilltop castle that
garrisoned two hundred Rajput soldiers. The next three days their camp stages
had been the towns of Viara, Corka, and the large garrison city of Narayanpur.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>On the insistence of Mirza Nuruddin, Hawksworth had carried
only a minimal amount of money with him. Instead he had adopted the practice of
Indian merchants, leaving a chest of silver in Surat and receiving a letter of
credit, which could be debited for cash at major stops along the road to Agra.
Moneylenders received negotiable notes against the silver deposit, which would
be paid in Surat at 7 percent surcharge, thereby allowing travelers along the
bandit-infested roads to carry cheques instead of cash.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth found himself annoyed that Vasant Rao never
allowed the caravan to stop inside the towns, where traditional Indian guest
houses—a stone floor and a roof— were available free for travelers. Instead
they camped each evening on the outskirts, while a few Rajputs rode in to the
town bazaar to buy fresh vegetables, bricks of cow dung for cooking, and betel
leaves for the drivers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The evening they reached Narayanpur, the governor of the
garrison, Partab Shah, had paid a surprise visit to their camp, bringing his
own troup of <i>nautch</i> women. While the women entertained the Rajputs with
an evening of dance and low-priced intimacy, Partab Shah whispered warnings to
Hawksworth that the road farther east was no longer safe now that civil rule in
the Deccan was teetering. The governor had offered to provide additional troops
to escort the English ambassador and his gifts for the Moghul safely through
the district. To the governor's—and Hawksworth's—dismay, Vasant Rao had
politely declined.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It had been well after midnight when the governor and his
aides rose to return to Narayanpur. Vasant Rao had insisted that the women be
sent with him. Then he convened the Rajputs and drivers and announced that they
would assemble the caravan two hours before sunup the following morning, an
hour earlier than usual. They would try to reach and ford the Tapti before
nightfall, then veer northeast for Burhanpur. Hawksworth thought he detected a
trace of worry in Vasant Rao's voice for the first time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>They were well underway by sunup the next day, and as he
fought off sleep in the rising heat, Hawksworth reflected on what he had seen
along the road. It was clear the larger towns were collection depots for the
Surat region, centers where grain, cotton, indigo, and hemp were assembled for
delivery to the port. As their caravan rumbled through town after town,
Hawksworth began to find them merely a provincial version of Surat, equally
frenetic and self-absorbed. Their bazaars bustled with haggling brokers and an
air of commerce triumphant. After a time he began to find them more wearisome
than exotic.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But between these towns lived the other India, one of
villages unchanged for centuries. To a Londoner and seaman they were another
world, and Hawksworth understood almost nothing of what he saw. Several times
he had started to ask Vasant Rao some question about a village, but the time
never seemed right. The Rajput was constantly occupied with the progress of the
caravan and never spoke unless he was giving an order. The long silence of the
road had gathered between them until it was almost an invisible wall.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>For no apparent reason this changed suddenly on the afternoon
after Narayanpur, as the caravan rumbled into the small village of Nimgul and
began working its way along the single road through the town. Vasant Rao drew
his mount alongside Hawksworth's and pointed to a white plaster building up
ahead that dominated the center of the village.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I grew to manhood in a village such as this, Captain,
in a house much like that one there.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth examined the well-kept house, and then the village
around it. Spreading away on all sides were tumbledown thatch-roofed homes of
sticks and clay, many raised on foot-high stilts to keep them above the
seasonal mud. Gaunt, naked children swarmed about the few remaining trees,
their voices piping shrilly at play, while elderly men lounged on the porches
smoking hookahs. Most of the able-bodied men seemed to be in the fields,
leaving their women—unsmiling laborers in drab body-length wraps, a large
marriage ring dangling from one nostril—to toil in the midday sun combing seeds
from large stacks of cotton, shelling piles of small-eared corn, and boiling a
dense brown liquid in wide iron pans.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Vasant Rao drew up his horse in front of the pans and spoke
rapidly with one of the sad-eyed women. There was a tinkle of her heavy silver
bracelets as she bowed to him, then turned to ask a turbaned overseer to offer
them two clay cups of the liquid. Vasant Rao threw the man a small coin, a
copper <i>pice</i>, and passed one of the cups to Hawksworth. It was viscous
and sweeter than anything he had ever tasted. Vasant Rao savored a mouthful,
then discarded the cup into the road.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;They're boiling cane juice to make <i>gur</i>, those
brown blocks of sugar you see in the bazaars, for the Brahmin landholders to
sell. She's a Camar, a low caste, and she works from sunup to dusk for a day's
supply of <i>chapattis</i>, fried wheat cakes, for her household. Wages haven't
risen in the villages since I was a boy.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Why did she ask the overseer to bring you the
cup?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Because I'm a Rajput.&quot; Vasant Rao seemed startled
by the question. &quot;I would pollute my caste if I took a cup from the hand
of a Camar. If a Rajput or a Brahmin eats food that's been handled by a member
of the low castes, he may be obligated to undergo ritual purification. If you
are born to a high caste, Captain, you must honor its obligations.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth studied him, wondering why he had finally decided
to talk.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Security had been unaccountably tight for a shipment of lead.
Vasant Rao had insisted that all carts be kept within the perimeter of the
camp, inside the circle of guards. No one, neither drivers nor guards, had been
allowed to touch the contents of the carts: sealed packages individually
wrapped and lashed in bricks.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Did you grow up around here?&quot; Hawksworth tried to
widen the opening.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;No, of course not.&quot; He laughed sharply. &quot;Only
a <i>feringhi</i> would ask that. I was born in the foothills of the Himalayas,
hundreds of <i>kos</i> north of Agra. In a Rajput village. The villages in the
Surat district are ruled by Brahmins.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Are Rajput villages like this?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;All villages are more or less the same, Captain. How
could it be otherwise? They're all Hindu. This is the real India, my friend.
Muslims and Moghuls, and now Christians, come and go. This stays the same.
These villages will endure long after the marble cities of the Moghuls are
dust. That's why I feel peace here. Knowing this cannot be destroyed, no matter
who rules in Agra.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth looked about the village. It seemed to be ruled by
cattle. They roamed freely, arrogantly, secure in the centuries-old instinct
that they were sacred and inviolable. Naked children had begun to swarm after
the carts, and a few young women paused to cast discreet glances at the
handsome Rajput horsemen. But the main work pressed monotonously forward. It
was a place untouched by the world beyond its horizons.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You said this was a Brahmin village. Are all the men
here priests?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Of course not.&quot; Vasant Rao grunted a laugh and
gestured toward the fields beyond. &quot;Who would do the work? There must be
the other castes, or the Brahmins would starve. Brahmins and Rajputs are
forbidden by the laws of caste from working the land. I meant this village is
ruled by Brahmins, although I'd guess no more than one family in ten is high
caste. The brick and plaster homes there in the center of the village probably
belong to Brahmins. The villages of India, Captain Hawksworth, are not ruled by
the Moghuls.They're ruled by the high castes. Here, the Brahmins, in other
villages, the Rajputs. These, together with some merchants called Banias, make
up the high-caste Hindus, the wearers of the sacred thread of the twice born,
the real owners and rules of India. All the other castes exist to serve
them.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I thought there were only four castes.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth remembered that Mukarrab Khan had once described
the caste system of the Hindus with obvious Muslim disgust. There are four
castes, he had explained, each striving to exploit those below. The greatest
exploiters called themselves Brahmin, probably Aryan invaders who had arrived
thousands of years past and now proclaimed themselves &quot;preservers of
tradition.&quot; That tradition, which they invented, was mainly subjugation of
all the others. Next came the Kshatriya, the warrior caste, which had been
claimed by Rajput tribes who also had invaded India, probably well after the
Brahmins. The third caste, also &quot;high,&quot; was called Vaisya, and was
supposed to be made up of society's producers of foods and goods. Now it was
the caste claimed by rich, grasping Hindu merchants. Below all these were the
Sudra, who were in effect the servants and laborers for the powerful
&quot;high&quot; castes. But even the Sudra had someone to exploit, for beneath
them were the Untouchables, those unfortunates in whose veins probably ran the
blood of the original inhabitants of India. The Untouchables had no caste. The
part that annoyed Mukarrab Khan the most was that high-caste Hindus regarded
all Muslims as part of the mass of Untouchables.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The four main castes are those prescribed in the order
of the <i>varna</i>, the ancient Aryan scriptures. But the world of the village
has little to do with the <i>varna</i>. Today there are many castes,&quot;
Vasant Rao continued, reflecting to himself how he loathed most Brahmins, who
took every opportunity to claim caste superiority over Rajputs. &quot;For
example, the Brahmins here probably have two subcastes—one for the priests, who
think up ceremonies as an excuse to collect money, and the other for the
landowners, most of whom are also moneylenders. &quot;There&quot;—he
pointed—&quot;that man is a Brahmin.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth saw a shirtless man standing by one of the white
plaster homes. He wore a dingy loincloth beneath his enormous belly, and as
Hawksworth examined him he noticed a strand of thread that circled around his
neck and under his left arm.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Why is he wearing a cord around his shoulder?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That's the sacred thread of the high castes. I wear one
myself.&quot; Vasant Rao opened his shirt to reveal a strand of three colored
threads, woven together. &quot;It's consecrated and given to boys around age
ten at a very important ceremony. Before the thread ceremony a boy has no
caste. An orthodox Brahmin won't even eat with his son until after the boy's
thread ceremony.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth examined the thread. It was the first time he'd
noticed it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What about the men who don't wear a thread?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;They're the middle castes, the ones who do the work in
a village. Carpenters, potters, weavers, barbers. They serve the high castes
and each other. The barber shaves the potter; the potter makes his vessels. The
Brahmins here probably won't sell them any land, so they'll always be poor.
That's why the middle castes live in houses of mud and thatch instead of brick.
And below them are the unclean castes. Sweepers, servants, shoemakers.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>And below them are the non-Hindus, Hawksworth thought. Me.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What the hell's the reason for all this? It's worse
than the class system in England. I'll drink with any man, high or low. I have.
And I usually prefer to drink with the low.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That may explain why most <i>feringhis</i> seem so
confused and unhappy. Caste is the most important thing in life.&quot; Vasant
Rao glanced over his shoulder at the receding village. &quot;It's the reason
India's civilization has lasted for thousands of years. I pity your misfortune,
Captain Hawksworth, not to have been born a Hindu. Perhaps you were once, and
will be again in some future life. I think you'll someday be reborn a
Kshatriya, a member of the warrior caste. Then you'll know who you are, what
you must do. Unlike the Moghuls and the other Muslims, who have no caste and
never know their purpose in life, a Rajput always knows.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As they rode on through the countryside Hawksworth tried to
understand the purpose of castes. Its absurdity annoyed him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Mukarrab khan was right for once. It's just a class system,
devised by the highborn to keep the others in submission. But why do they all
seem to believe in it? Why don't the so-called lower castes just tell the
others to go to hell?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As they neared the next village, he decided to try to guess
who was in which caste. But the central road in the village was deserted.
Instead all the villagers, men and women, were clustered around a tall,
brightly painted pole that had been erected near one of the dingy thatch homes.
Vasant Rao's face brightened when he saw the pole.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;There must be a wedding here today. Have you ever seen
one?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;No. Not in India.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;This is a powerful moment, Captain, when you feel the
force of <i>prahna</i>, the life spirit.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Vasant Rao pointed toward a pavilion that had been erected
next to the marriage pole. From horseback Hawksworth could just make out the
bride and groom, both dressed in red wraps trimmed in silver. The groom wore a
high turban, on top of which were ceremonial decorations, and the bride was so
encrusted with precious metals she might have been a life-size ornament: her
hands, wrists, feet, ankles, and her head were all adorned with elaborately
worked silver rings, bracelets, medallions. Her necklace was a string of large
gold coins.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Where'd she get all the silver and gold?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Her father is probably a big landowner. Those ornaments
are her savings and part of her dowry. Look, all the women wear thick bracelets
of silver on their ankles. There's much gold and silver in India,
Captain.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As Hawksworth watched, a Brahmin priest, his forehead
streaked with white clay, finished lighting a fire in a central brazier and
then began to recite.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The priest is reciting from the Vedas, Sanskrit
scriptures thousands of years old,&quot; Vasant Rao continued as they watched.
&quot;This is a ritual going back to the dawn of time.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The couple began repeating the priest's verses, their faces
intent and solemn.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;They're taking the marriage vows now. There are seven.
The most important is the wife's vow of complete obedience to her husband. See
the silver knife he carries? That's to symbolize his dominion over her. But
really, she will belong to his entire family when she finally comes to live at
his house.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What do you mean by 'finally'?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;These things take time. To begin with, a marriage
proposal must come from the family of the girl. As she approaches womenhood,
her father will hire a marriage broker, probably the village barber, to go to
surrounding villages to look for a suitable match. I remember when I was young
and they used to come to my village.&quot; Vasant Rao's face assumed a faraway
expression. &quot;I didn't want to marry and I dreaded seeing them, but
unfortunately I was a good catch. My subcaste is high, and I had many sisters,
which meant more women to share the work in our house. Then one day my father
ordered the priest to cast my horoscope and I knew I was lost. A broker had
brought an inquiry from a girl who had a compatible horoscope. Soon after, the
engagement ceremony was held in our house. The girl was not there, of course; I
didn't see her until three years later. When we finally had the ceremony you
see here.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The bride and groom were standing together now, and they
began to circle the fire while the women standing nearby sang a monotonous,
repetitive song. Hawksworth counted seven turns of the fire. Then they seated
themselves and the priest placed a red dot on the forehead of man and wife.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;They'll feast tonight, and then the groom will return
to his village.&quot; Vasant Rao spurred his mount to catch up with the
caravan. &quot;Later she and her family will go there for more ceremonies.
After that the groom may not see her again for several years, until the day her
father decides she's ready for the <i>gauna</i>, the consummation of the
marriage. I didn't see my bride again for two years.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What happened then?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;She came to my village for a few days and stayed in the
women's quarters—the men and women sleep apart in these villages—and I had to
go there and try to find her cot. After that she went back home and it was
several months later before I saw her again. Then she came back, for a longer
time. Finally she moved to my village, but by then I was nineteen and soon
after I left on a campaign. She stayed with my younger brother while I was
gone, and when I returned, she was with child. Who can say whether it was mine
or his? But none of it matters, for she died in childbirth.&quot; He spurred
his horse past the line of carts. &quot;Let's try to make the river before
sundown.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth couldn't believe what he had heard, and he whipped
his mount to catch up.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Your brother kept your wife while you were away?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Of course. I don't know how it is here, but in the part
of India where I was born, brothers normally share each other's wives. I used
to go to my older brother's house when he was gone and visit his wife. She
expected it and would have been upset if I hadn't come to her.&quot; Vasant Rao
was puzzled by Hawksworth's surprise. &quot;Don't brothers share one another's
wives in England?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, not. . . usually. I mean . . . no. Hell no. It's
damned close to incest. The truth is a husband would have grounds to call out a
man he caught with his wife. And especially a brother.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;'Call him out,' Captain? What does that mean?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;A duel. With swords. Or maybe pistols.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Vasant Rao was incredulous.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But what if a man goes away on a campaign? His wife
will grow frustrated. Hindus believe a woman has seven times the sexual energy
of a man. She would start meeting other men in the village if a man didn't have
a brother to keep her satisfied. In the village where I grew up, if a man and
woman met together by chance in the forest, and they had the same caste, we all
assumed they would make the most of the opportunity. So it's better for the
honor of the family if your brothers care for your wife. It's an important duty
for brothers. And besides, as long as a woman attends to her own husband's
needs, what does it matter if his brother enjoys her also?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth found himself astonished.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;How does . . . I mean, what about this brother's own
wife? What does she think about all this?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;If her husband wants to visit his brothers' wives, what
should she care? It's normal. She'll also find ways to meet her husband's
brothers for the same purpose. Women married to brothers often try to send each
other away on errands, in order to enjoy the other's husband. So wives have no
reason to complain. In fact, if a woman returns to her own village for a visit,
she will probably seek out some of the men she knew when she was young and
enjoy them, since her husband is not around and no one in her own village would
tell him. Hindus in the villages don't lock away their women the way the Muslims
do, Captain Hawksworth. And because they're free to enjoy whoever they wish,
they aren't frustrated and unhappy the way Muslim women are. Surely your
England is an advanced country where women have the same freedom.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth puzzled for a minute before trying to answer. The
truth is there's a big difference between what's said and what's done. With
chastity praised from the pulpits and whores the length of London. And highborn
ladies thronging the playhouses, ready to cuckold their husbands with any cavalier
who'll give them a look. How can I explain it?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I guess you'd say upper-class women have the most
freedom to take lovers. Usually young gallants or soldiers. And no one is
surprised if her husband makes full use of his serving wench.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Are these soldiers and serving women from a lower
caste?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, we don't exactly have . . .&quot; Hawksworth
paused for a moment. &quot;Actually I guess you could say they're a lower
'caste,' in a way.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Vasant reined in his mount and inspected Hawksworth for a
moment in disgust.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Please excuse me if I say yours must be a very immoral
country. Captain. Such a thing would never happen in India. No Rajput would
touch the body of a low caste. It would be pollution.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You don't care what your women do? All that matters is
who they do it with?&quot; Hawksworth suddenly realized he found it all too
absurd to believe. It sounds like another tale of the Indies. Concocted to
entertain credulous seamen. &quot;All right, then, what about your own wife?
Did she have other men besides your brothers?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;How would I know?&quot; Vasant Rao waved his hand,
dismissing the question as insignificant. &quot;I suppose it's possible. But
after she died I decided I'd had enough of wives and women. I took a vow of
chastity. There's the legend of a god named Hanumanji, who took on the flesh of
a monkey and who gained insuperable strength by retaining his semen. It made
him invulnerable.&quot; Vasant Rao smiled. &quot;So far it's worked for me as
well. But to protect the charm, I eat no meat and drink a glass of opium each
day.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The Rajput suddenly spurred his mount toward the head of the
caravan. The sun had disappeared behind a heavy bank of storm clouds in the
west, and the road had already begun to darken. The river was probably still
another hour away, perhaps two hours.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth studied Vasant Rao's tall, commanding form,
sitting erect and easy in the saddle.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Sweet Jesus, he thinks he's invulnerable because he avoids
women and drinks opium. Rajputs are even madder than the damned Turks. And he
thinks the high castes rule by the will of God. I wonder what the low castes
think?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth puzzled through the Rajput's words and half-dozed
in the saddle until he realized they were finally approaching the river. Ahead,
past groves of mango trees, lay a sandy expanse leading down toward the water's
edge. As they approached, Vasant Rao sent some of his horsemen to scout along
the riverbank in both directions to find a shallow spot for crossing. The
caravan followed the stream for half a <i>kos</i>, then halted on a sandy plain
that sloped gradually down toward the wide stream. The water rippled slightly
all the way across, signifying there were no lurking depths to swallow a cart.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The sun was dying, washing a veneer of gold over the high
dark clouds threatening in the east. The smell of rain hinted in the evening
air. Vasant Rao peered across the water's darkening surface for a time, while
the drivers waited patiently for orders to begin crossing, then he turned to
the waiting Rajputs.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The light is too far gone.&quot; He stroked the mane of
his gray stallion and again studied the clouds building where the sun had been.
&quot;It's safer to camp here and cross in the morning.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He signaled the head driver and pointed the Rajputs toward a
sandy expanse close to the water's edge. In moments the drivers were urging their
teams toward the spot, circling them in preparation for the night.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The carts will go on the riverside, and we'll camp
here.&quot; He specified areas for the Rajputs and the drivers, and then he
turned to Hawksworth and pointed out a large mango tree. &quot;Your tent can go
there.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth had been required by the Rajputs to keep a
separate area for his campfire and cooking. Vasant Rao had explained the
reasons the first evening of the journey.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Food is merely an external part of the body, Captain,
so naturally it must be kept from pollution. Food is transformed into blood,
and the blood eventually turns to flesh, the flesh to fat, and the fat to
marrow. The marrow turns to semen, the life-force. Since you have no caste, a
Rajput would become polluted if he allowed you to touch his food, or even the
pots in which he cooked.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth's driver, being a low caste, had no objection to
cooking and eating with the English ambassador. Their diet on the trip had been
simple. The Rajputs lived mainly on game they killed as they rode, though some
occasionally ate fish. A few seemed to subsist on rice, wheat cakes, and boiled
lentils. That night, as an experiment, Hawksworth ordered his driver, Nayka, to
prepare a dinner of whatever he himself was having. Then he reclined against
his saddle, poured himself a tankard of brandy, and watched the preparations.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Nayka struck up a fire of twigs, to ignite the chips of dried</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>cow dung
used for the real cooking, and then he began to heat a curved pan containing <i>ghee</i>,
butter that had been boiled and strained to prevent rancidity. Although the
Rajputs cooked in vegetable oil, Nayka had insisted from the first that a
personage as important as the English <i>feringhi</i> should eat only clarified
butter. The smoldering chips of dung took a long time to heat, but finally the
ghee seemed ready. Nayka had ground spices as he waited, and he began to throw
them into the hot fat to sputter. Then he chopped vegetables and dropped them
in to fry. In a separate pot he was already boiling lentils, together with a
yellow spice he called turmeric. As the meal neared readiness, he began to fry <i>chappatis</i>,
thin patties of unleavened wheat flour mixed with water and ghee. Then
Hawksworth watched in shock as Nayka discreetly dropped a coal of burning cow
dung into the pot of cooking lentils.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What the hell was that?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Flavoring, Captain Sahib.&quot; Nayka's Turkish had
been learned through procuring women for Turkish seamen, and it was heavily
accented and abrupt. &quot;It's the secret of the flavor of our lentils.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Is that 'high-caste' practice?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I think it is the same for all.&quot; Nayka examined
him for a moment, twisting his head deferentially. &quot;Does the Sahib know
about caste?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I know it's a damnable practice.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The Sahib says what the Sahib says, but caste is a very
good thing.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;How do you figure that?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Because I will be reborn a Brahmin. I went to a
soothsayer who told me. My next life will be marvelous.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But what about this life?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;My present birth was due to a very grave mistake. The
soothsayer explained it. He said that in my last life I was a Rajput. Once I
ordered my cook to prepare a gift for some Brahmins, to bake bread for them,
and inside the bread I had put gold. It was an act of great merit. But the
faithless cook betrayed me. He stole the gold and put stones in its place. The
Brahmins were very insulted, but no one ever told me why. Because I had
insulted Brahmins, I was reborn as I am. But my next life will be different. I
will be rich and have many women. Like a Brahmin or a Rajput.&quot; Nayka's eyes
gleamed in anticipation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The improvement in money I can understand.&quot;
Hawksworth examined Nayka's ragged dhoti. &quot;But what does it matter when it
comes to women? There seems to be plenty of randy women to go around, in all
castes.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That's true if you are a Rajput or a Brahmin. Then no
woman of any caste can refuse you. But if you are a low caste, and you are
caught with a high-caste woman, you'll probably be beaten to death by the
Rajputs. They would say you were polluting her caste.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Wait a minute. I thought Rajputs would have nothing to
do with a low-caste woman.&quot; Hawksworth remembered Vasant Rao's stern
denial.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Who told you that?&quot; Nayka smiled at Hawksworth's
naivete. &quot;I would guess a Rajput. They always deny it to strangers, so you
won't form unfavorable ideas about the high castes. Let me tell you that it is
a lie, Captain Sahib. They take our women all the time, and there is nothing we
can say. But a low-caste man with a high-caste woman is another matter.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But what about their 'ritual pollution'? They're not
supposed to touch the low castes.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It's very simple. A Rajput can take one of our women if
he chooses, and then just take a bath afterward and he is clean again.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But can't a high-caste woman do the same, if she's been
with a low-caste man?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;No, Captain Sahib. Because they say her pollution is
internal. She has the polluting emissions of the low-caste man within her. So
there is no way she can be purified. It's the way the high castes control their
women. But if you're a man, you can have any woman you please, and there's
nothing anyone can say.&quot; Again Nayka's eyes brightened. &quot;It will be
wonderful the day I am reborn. Caste is a wonderful thing.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth studied the half-starved, almost toothless</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>man who
stood before him barefoot, grinning happily.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Well, enjoy your dreams, you poor miserable son-of-a- bitch.
I'll not be the one to tell you this life is all you get.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He took a slug of brandy and returned to his dung-flavored
lentils. Taken with some of the charcoal-flavored bread they were actually better
than he'd expected.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Vasant Rao had already summoned the Rajputs and made
assignments for the evening guard duty. Guards were to be doubled. Hawksworth
remained astounded by the Rajput concept of security. A large kettledrum was
set up at the head of the camp and continually beaten from dusk to dawn. A
detail of Rajputs would march around the perimeter of the camp throughout the
night, and on the quarter hour a shout of &quot;khabardar,&quot; meaning
&quot;take heed,&quot; would circle the camp. The first night Hawksworth had
found it impossible to sleep for the noise, but the second night and thereafter
his weariness overtook him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He poured himself another brandy and watched as Nayka
scrubbed out the cooking pans with ashes and sand. Then the driver rolled a
betel leaf for Hawksworth and another for himself and set to work erecting the
tent, which was nothing more than four poles with a canopy. After this he
unloaded Hawksworth's cot, a foot-high wooden frame strung with hemp. None of
the Rajputs used cots; they preferred a thin pallet on the ground.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Nayka seemed to work more slowly as he started unrolling the
bedding onto the hemp strings of the cot, and he began to glance nervously at
the sky. Suddenly he stopped and slipped quietly to where the other drivers
were encamped, seated on their haunches around a fire, passing the mouthpiece
of a hookah. A long discussion followed, with much pointing at the sky. Then
Nayka returned and approached Hawksworth, twisting his head in the deferential
bow all Indians seemed to use to superiors. He stood for a moment in
hesitation, and then summoned the courage to speak.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It is not well tonight. Sahib. We have traveled this
road many times.&quot; He pointed east into the dark, where new lightning
played across the hovering bank of clouds. &quot;There has been rain near
Chopda, farther east where the river forks. In two <i>pahars</i> time, six of
your hours, the river will begin to rise here.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;How much will it rise?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Only the gods can tell. But the river will spread
beyond its banks and reach this camp. I have seen it. And it will remain
impassable for three days.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;How can you be sure?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I have seen it before, Sahib. The drivers all know and
they are becoming afraid. We know the treachery of this river very well. But
the other bank is near high ground. If we crossed tonight we would be
safe.&quot; Again he shifted his head deferentially. &quot;Will you please tell
the raja?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>To the drivers, Vasant Rao could only be a raja, a hereditary
prince. All important Rajputs were automatically called rajas.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Tell him yourself.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We would rather you tell him, Captain Sahib. He is a
high caste. It would not be right for us to tell a raja what to do.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth watched for a moment as the Rajput guards began
taking thei</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>r place</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> around the perimeter of the camp,
and then he looked sadly at his waiting cot.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Damn. Crossing in the dark could be a needless risk. Why
didn't the drivers say something while we still had light? God curse them and
their castes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then with a shrug of resignation he rose and made his way to
Vasant Rao's tent.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The Rajput leader had already removed his helmet, but after
listening to Hawksworth he reluctantly strapped it back on and called for his
second in command. Together they examined the clouds and then walked down to
the river.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>In the dark no one could tell if it had begun to rise. Vasant
Rao ordered three Rajputs to ride across carrying torches, to test the depth
and mark out a path. The river was wide, but it still was no more than a foot
or two deep. When the third Rajput finally reached the far shore, over a
hundred yards away, Vasant Rao issued orders to assemble the convoy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The drivers moved quickly to harness their bullocks, which
had been tethered to stakes near bundles of hay. The weary cattle tossed their
heads and sniffed suspiciously at the moist air as they were whipped into
harness. Meanwhile the Rajput guards began saddling their horses.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth saddled his own mare and watched as his cot and
tent were rolled and strapped into the cart alongside his chest. He stared
again into the darkness that enveloped the river. Nothing could be seen except
the three torches on the distant shore. Suddenly he seemed to hear a warning
bell in the back of his mind.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>We're too exposed. Half the guard will be in the river while
we cross. And there'll be no way to group the carts if we need to.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He paused a moment, then retrieved his sword from the cart
and buckled it on. Next he checked the prime on the two matchlock pocket
pistols he carried, one in each boot.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Five mounted Rajputs holding torches led as the convoy
started across the sandy alluvium toward the river. Hawksworth's cart was the
first to move, and as he drew his mare alongside, Nayka threw him a grateful
smile through the flickering light of the torch strapped against one of the
cart's poles.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You've saved us all. Captain Sahib. When the river
grows angry, nothing can appease her.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The bullocks nosed warily at the water, but Nayka gave them
the lash and they waded in without protest. The bed was gravel, smoothed by the
long action of the stream, and the water was still shallow, allowing the large
wheels of the carts to roll easily. Hawksworth pulled his mount close to the
cart and let its enormous wheel splash coolness against his horse's flank.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The current grew swifter as they reached the center of the stream,
but the bullocks plodded along evenly, almost as though they were on dry
ground. Then the current eased again, and Hawksworth noticed that the Rajputs
riding ahead had already reined in their mounts, signifying they had gained the
far shore. Their five torches merged with the three of the Rajputs already
waiting, and together they lined the water's edge.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth twisted in the saddle and looked back at the line
of carts. They traveled abreast in pairs, a torchman riding between, and the
caravan had become an eerie procession of waving lights and shadows against the
dark water. The last carts were in the river now, and Vasant Rao was riding
rapidly toward him, carrying a torch.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Looks like I was wrong again, Hawksworth thought, and he
turned to rein his horse as it stumbled against a submerged rock.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The torches along the shore were gone.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He stared in disbelief for a moment, and then he saw them
sputtering in the water's edge. Lightning flashed in the east, revealing the
silhouettes of the Rajputs' mounts, stumbling along the shore, their saddles
empty. He whirled to check the caravan behind him, and at that moment an arrow
ricocheted off the pole of the cart and ripped cleanly through the side of his
jerkin. He suddenly realized the torch lashed to the side of the cart
illuminated him brilliantly, and he drew his sword and swung at its base,
slicing it in half. As it fell, sputtering, he saw a second arrow catch Nayka
squarely in the throat and he watched the driver spin and slump wordlessly into
the water.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Godforsaken luckless Hindu. Now you can be reborn a Brahmin.
Only sooner than you thought.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>A shout of alarm erupted from behind, and he looked to see
the remaining Rajputs charging in formation, bows already drawn. The water
churned around him as they dashed by, advancing on the shore. The Rajputs' horn
bows hissed in rapid succession as they sent volleys of bamboo arrows into the
darkness. But the returning rain of arrows was dense and deadly. He saw the
Rajput nearest him suddenly pivot backward in the saddle, an arrow lodged in
his groin, below his leather chest guard. Hawksworth watched incredulously as
the man clung to his saddle horn for a long last moment, pulling himself erect
and releasing a final arrow before tumbling into the water.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Again lightning flared across the sky, and in the sudden
illumination Hawksworth could see shapes along the shore, an army of mounted
horsemen, well over a hundred. They</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>were drawn
in tight formation, calmly firing into the approaching Rajputs. The lightning
flashed once more, a broad sheet of fire across the sky, and at that moment
Hawksworth saw Vasant Rao gain the shore, where he was instantly surrounded by
a menacing wall of shields and pikes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then more of the Rajputs gained the shore, and he could hear
their chant of &quot;Ram Ram,&quot; their famous battle cry. The horsemen were
moving on the caravan now, and when the lightning blazed again Hawksworth
realized he had been surrounded.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The dark figure in the lead seized Hawksworth's right arm
from behind and began to grapple for his sword. As he struggled to draw it
away, the butt end of a pike came down hard on his forearm. A shot of pain
pierced through to his mind, clearing away the last haze of the brandy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You bastard.&quot; Hawksworth realized he was shouting
in English. &quot;Get ready to die.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He twisted forward and with his free hand stretched for the
pistol in his boot. Slowly his grip closed about the cool horn of the handle,
and with a single motion he drew it upward, still grasping the sword.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As he raised himself erect he caught the outline of a dark
object swinging above him in the air. Then the lightning flashed again,
glinting off the three large silver knobs. They were being swung by the man who
held his sword arm.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>My God, it's a <i>gurz</i>, the three-headed club some of the
Rajputs carry on their saddle. It's a killer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He heard it arc above him, singing through the dark. Unlike
the Rajputs, he had no leather helmet, no padded armor. There was no time to
avoid the blow, but he had the pistol now, and he shoved it into the man's gut
and squeezed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>There was a sudden blinding flash of light. It started at his
hand, but then it seemed to explode inside his skull. The world had grown
white, like the marble walls of Mukarrab Khan's music room, and for a moment he
thought he heard again the echo of drumbeats. The cycle swelled sensuously,
then suddenly reached its culmination, when all pent-up emotion dissolved. In
the silence that followed, there was only the face of Mukarrab Khan, surrounded
by his eunuchs, his smile slowly fading into black.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>       The
light of a single flame tip burned through the haze of his vision, and then he
heard words around him, in a terse language as ancient as time. He tried to
move, and an aching soreness shot through his shoulders and into his groin. His
head seemed afire.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He forced his swollen eyelids wider, and a room slowly began
to take form. It was a cell, with heavy bamboo slats over the windows and an
ancient wooden latch on the door. The floor was earth and the walls gray mud
with occasional inscriptions in red. Next to him was a silhouette, the outline
of a man squatting before an oil lamp and slowly repeating a sharp, toneless
verse. He puzzled at the words as he studied the figure.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It's the language of the priest at the wedding. It must be

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He pulled himself upward on an elbow and turned toward the
figure, which seemed to flicker in the undulating shadows. Then he recognized
the profile of Vasant Rao. The verses stopped abruptly and the Rajput turned to
examine him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;So you're not dead? That could be a mistake you'll
regret.&quot; Vasant Rao's face sagged and his once-haughty moustache was an
unkempt tangle. He stared at Hawksworth a moment more, then turned back to the
lamp. The Sanskrit verses resumed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

&quot;The bastards killed my driver.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>      
&quot;The driver was nothing. A low caste.&quot; He shrugged it away. &quot;You
are an important <i>feringhi</i>. You would not have been harmed. You should
never have drawn a pistol. And then you allowed yourself to be captured. It was
an act beneath honor. The women spat on you and your horse when you were
brought through the streets. I have no doubt they'll kill us both now.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Who's left alive?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;No one. My men died like Rajputs.&quot; A trace of
pride flashed through his eyes before they dimmed again with sadness.
&quot;When they knew they could not win, that they had failed the prince, they
vowed to die fighting. And all did.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But you're still alive.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The words seemed almost like a knife in the Rajput's heart.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;They would not kill me. Or let me die honorably.&quot;
He paused and stared at Hawksworth. &quot;There was a reason, but it doesn't
concern you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;So all the men died? But why did they kill the
drivers?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The drivers weren't killed.&quot; Vasant Rao looked
surprised. &quot;I never said that.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I keep forgetting, Hawksworth told himself, that only high
castes count as men in this God-forsaken land.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;This whole damned country is mad.&quot; The absurdity
overwhelmed him. &quot;Low castes, your own people, handled like slaves, and
high castes who kill each other in the name of honor. A pox on Rajputs and
their fornicating honor.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Honor is very important. Without honor what is left? We
may as well be without caste. The warrior caste lives by a code set down in the
Laws of Manu many thousands of years ago.&quot; He saw Hawksworth's impatience
and smiled sadly. &quot;Do you understand what's meant by <i>dharma</i>?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It sounds like another damned Hindu invention. Another
excuse to take life.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;<i>Dharma</i> is something, Captain Hawksworth, without
which life no longer matters. No Christian, or Muslim, has ever been able to
understand <i>dharma</i>, since it is the order that defines our castes—and
those born outside India are doomed to live forever without a caste. <i>Dharma</i>
defines who we are and what we must do if we are to maintain our caste. Warfare
is the <i>dharma</i> of the Kshatriya, the warrior caste.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And I say a pox on caste. What's so honorable about
Rajputs slaughtering each other?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Warriors are bound by their <i>dharma</i> to join in
battle against other warriors. A warrior who fails in his duty sins against the
<i>dharma</i> of his caste.&quot; Vasant Rao paused. &quot;But why am I
bothering to tell you this? I sound like Krishna, lecturing Arjuna on his duty
as a warrior.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Who's Krishna? Another Rajput?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;He's a god, Captain Hawksworth, sacred to all Rajputs.
He teaches us that a warrior must always honor his <i>dharma</i>.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Vasant Rao's eyes seemed to burn through the shadows of the
cell. From outside Hawksworth heard the distant chantings of some village
ceremony.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;If you'll listen, <i>feringhi</i> captain, I'll tell
you something about a warrior's <i>dharma</i>. There's a legend, many thousands
of years old, of a great battle joined between two branches of a powerful
dynasty in ancient India. Two kings were brothers, and they shared a kingdom,
but their sons could not live in peace. One branch wished to destroy the other.
Eventually a battle was joined, a battle to the death. As they waited on the
field for the sound of the conch shell, to summon the forces, the leader of
those sons who had been wronged suddenly declared that he could not bring
himself to kill his own kinsmen. But the god Krishna, who was charioteer for
this son, reminded him he must follow his <i>dharma</i>. That there is no
greater good for a warrior than to join battle for what is right. It's wrong
only if he is attached to the fruits of battle, if he does it for gain. It's
told in the Bhagavad-Gita, a Sanskrit scripture sacred to all warriors. I was
reciting a verse from Chapter Twelve when you woke.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What did this god Krishna say?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;He declared that all who live must die, and all who die
will be reborn. The spirit within us all, the <i>atman</i>, cannot be
destroyed. It travels through us on its journey from birth to rebirth. But it's
not correct to say merely that it exists. It is existence. It is the only
reality. It is present in everything because it is everything. Therefore
there's no need to mourn for death. There is no death. The body is merely an
appearance, by which the <i>atman</i> reveals itself. The body is only its
guardian. But a warrior who turns away from the duty of his caste sins against
his honor and his <i>dharma</i>. Krishna warned that this loss of honor could
one day lead to the mixture of castes, and then the dharma of the universe, its
necessary order, would be destroyed. It's not wrong for a Rajput to kill a
worthy foe, Captain Hawksworth, it's his duty. Just as it's also his duty to
die a worthy death.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Why all this killing in the name of 'honor' and
'duty&quot;?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Non-Hindus always want to know 'why.' To 'understand.'
You always seem to believe that words somehow contain all truth. But dharma
simply is. It is the air we breathe, the changeless order around us. We're part
of it. Does the earth ask why the monsoons come? Does the seed ask why the sun
shines each day? No. It's <i>dharma</i>. The dharma of the seed is to bear
fruit. The dharma of the warrior caste is to do battle. Only <i>feringhi</i>,
who live outside our dharma, ask 'why.' Truth is not something you
'understand.' It's something you're part of. It's something you feel with your
being. And when you try to catch it with words, it's gone. Can the eagle tell
you how he flies, Captain Hawksworth, or 'why&quot;? If he could, he would no
longer be an eagle. This is the great wisdom of India. We've learned it's
wasted on <i>feringhi</i>, Captain, as I fear it's now wasted on you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The talk left Hawksworth feeling strangely insecure, his mind
wrestling with ideas that defied rationality.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I know there are things you understand with your gut,
not with your head.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then there may be hope for you, Captain Hawksworth. Now
we will see if you can die like a Rajput. If you can, perhaps you will be
reborn one of us.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then I might even learn to be a bandit.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;All Rajputs are not the same, Captain. There are many
tribes, descended from different dynasties. Each has its own tradition and
genealogy. I'm from the north. From the races descended from the moon. This
tribe claims descent from the solar dynasty, which also began in the north. I
think their genealogy goes back to the god Indra, who they claim brought them
into being with the aid of the sun.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Vasant Rao turned and continued reciting in Sanskrit. His
face again became a mask.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth rubbed his head in confusion and suddenly felt a
hard lump where the club had dropped. The fear began to well up in his stomach
as he remembered the stony-faced riders who had surrounded him in the river.
But he pushed aside thoughts of death.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Dharma</span></i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>
be damned. What did he mean, they're members of a clan descended from the
&quot;solar dynasty&quot;? They're killers, looking for an excuse to plunder.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I'm not planning to die like a Rajput just yet. Or be reborn
as one. Life is too sweet just as it is. I'm beginning to feel alive here, for
the first time ever. Shirin is free. I've got a feeling I'll be seeing her
again. Whatever happens, I don't care to die in this piss hole, with empty talk
about honor. Think.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He remembered the river again, and quickly felt in his boot.
The other pistol was still there.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>We'll find a way to get out. Somehow. We may just lose a few
days' time, that's all. We made good time so far. Six days. We left on Sunday,
and we've been here two days. So today is probably Monday.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He suddenly froze.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Where are the carts?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;At the south end of the village. Where they have the <i>chans</i>,
the cattle sheds. The drivers are there too.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Is my chest there?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;No. It's right there. Behind you.&quot; Vasant Rao
pointed into the dark. &quot;I told them it belonged to the Moghul, and they
brought it here. I guess the Moghul still counts for something here. Maybe
they're superstitious about him.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth pulled himself up and reached behind him. The
chest was there. He fingered the cool metal of the lock and his mind began to
clear even more. Quickly he began to search his jerkin for the key. Its pockets
were empty.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Of course. If I was tied over a horse it.. .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then he remembered. For safety he had transferred it to the
pocket of his breeches the second day out. He felt down his leg, fighting the
ache in his arm.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Miraculously the key was still there.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He tried to hold his excitement as he twisted it into the
lock on the chest. Once, twice, and it clicked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He quickly checked the contents. Lute on top. Letter, still
wrapped. Clothes. Then he felt deeper and touched the metal. Slowly he drew it
out, holding his breath. It was still intact.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The light from the lamp glanced off the burnished brass of
the Persian astrolabe from the observatory. It had been Mukarrab Khan's parting
gift.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He carried it to the slatted window and carefully twisted
each slat until the sun began to stream through.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Thank God it's late in the year, when the sun's already lower
at midday.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He took a quick reading of the sun's elevation. It had not
yet reached its zenith. He made a mental note of the reading and began to wait.
Five minutes passed—they seemed hours—and he checked the elevation again. The
sun was still climbing, but he knew it would soon reach its highest point.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Vasant Rao continued to chant verses from the Bhagavad- Gita
in terse, toneless Sanskrit.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He probably thinks I'm praying too, Hawksworth smiled to
himself.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The reading increased, then stayed the same, then began to
decrease. The sun had passed its zenith, and he had the exact reading of its
elevation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He mentally recorded the reading, then began to rummage in
the bottom of the chest for the seaman's book he always carried with him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>We left Surat on October twenty-fourth. So October
twenty-fifth was Karod, the twenty-sixth was Viara, the twenty-seventh was Corka,
the twenty-eighth was Narayanpur, the twenty-ninth was the river. Today has to
be October thirty-first.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The book was there, its pages still musty from the moist air
at sea. He reached the page he wanted and ran his finger down a column of
figures until he reached the one he had read off the astrolabe.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>From the reading the latitude here is 21 degrees and 20</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>minutes
north.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then he began to search the chest for a sheaf of papers and
finally his fingers closed around them, buried beneath his spare jerkin. He
squinted in the half light as he went through the pages, the handwriting
hurried from hasty work in the observatory. Finally he found what he wanted. He
had copied it directly from the old Samarkand astronomer's calculations. The
numerals were as bold as the day he had written them. The latitude was there,
and the date.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>With a tight smile that pained his aching face he carefully
wrapped the astrolabe and returned it to the bottom of the chest, together with
the books. He snapped the lock in place just as the door of the cell swung
open.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He looked up to see the face of the man who had swung the
club.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Good Jesus, I thought he was dead. And he looks even younger.
. . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then Hawksworth realized it had to be his son. But the heavy
brow, the dark beard, the narrow eyes, were all the same, almost as though his
father's blood had flowed directly into his veins. He wore no helmet or
breastplate now, only a simple robe, entirely white.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The man spoke curtly to Vasant Rao in a language Hawksworth
did not understand.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;He has ordered us to come with him. It's time for the
ceremony. He says you must watch how the man you killed is honored.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Vasant Rao rose easily and pinched out the oil lamp. In the
darkened silence Hawksworth heard the lowing of cattle, as well as the distant
drone of a chant. Outside the guards were waiting. He noted they carried
sheathed swords. And they too were dressed in white.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>In the midday sunshine he quickly tried to survey the
terrain. Jagged rock outcrops seemed to ring the village, with a gorge
providing an easily protected entrance.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He was right. It's a fortress. And probably impregnable.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The road was wide, with rows of mud-brick homes on either
side, and ahead was an open square, where a crowd had gathered. Facing the
square, at the far end, was an immense house of baked brick, the largest in the
fortress village, with a wide front and a high porch.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As they approached the square, Hawksworth realized a deep pit
had been newly excavated directly in the center. Mourners clustered nearby,
silently waiting, while a group of women—five in all—held hands and moved
slowly around the pit intoning a dirge.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As they reached the side of the opening he saw the Rajput's
body, lying face up on a fragrant bier of sandalwood and <i>neem</i> branches.
His head and beard had been shaved and his body bound in a silk winding sheet.
He was surrounded by garlands of flowers. The wood in the pit smelled of <i>ghee</i>
and rose-scented coconut oil. Nearby, Brahmin priests recited in Sanskrit.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;His body will be cremated with the full honor of a
Rajput warrior.&quot; Vasant Rao stood alongside. &quot;It's clear the Brahmins
have been paid enough.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth looked around at the square and the nearby houses,
their shutters all sealed in mourning. Chanting priests in ceremonial robes had
stationed themselves near the large house, and an Arabian mare, all white and
bedecked with flowers, was tied at the entrance. Suddenly the tones of
mournful, discordant music sounded around him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As Hawksworth watched, the heavy wooden doors of the great
house opened slowly and a woman stepped into the midday sunshine. Even from
their distance he could see that she was resplendent—in an immaculate white
wrap that sparkled with gold ornaments—and her movements regal as she descended
the steps and was helped onto the horse. As she rode slowly in the direction of
the pit, she was supported on each side by Brahmin priests, long-haired men
with stripes of white clay painted down their forehead.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;She is his wife.&quot; Vasant Rao had also turned to
watch. &quot;Now you'll see a woman of the warrior caste follow her <i>dharma</i>.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As the woman rode slowly by, Hawksworth sensed she was only
barely conscious of her surroundings, as though she had been drugged. She
circled the pit three times, then stopped near where Hawksworth and Vasant Rao
were standing. As the priests helped her down from the mare, one urged her to
drink again from a cup of dense liquid he carried. Her silk robe was fragrant
with scented oil, and Hawksworth saw that decorations of saffron and sandalwood
had been applied to her arms and forehead.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It's a curious form of mourning. She's dressed and perfumed
as though for a banquet, not a funeral. And what's she drinking? From the way
she moves I'd guess it's some opium concoction.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She paused at the edge of the pit and seemed to glare for an
instant at the five women who moved around her. Then she drank again from the
cup, and calmly began removing her jewels, handing them to the priest, until
her only ornament was a necklace of dark seeds. Next the Brahmins sprinkled her
head with water from a pot and, as a bell began to toll, started helping her
into the pit. Hawksworth watched in disbelief as she knelt next to her
husband's body and lovingly cradled his head against her lap. Her eyes were
lifeless but serene.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The realization of what was happening struck Hawksworth like
a blow in the chest. But how could it be true? It was unthinkable.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then the man who had brought them, the son, held out his hand
and one of the Brahmins bowed and handed him a burning torch. It flared
brilliantly against the dark pile of earth at the front of the pit.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>God Almighty! No! Hawksworth instinctively started to reach
for his pistol.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>A deafening chorus of wails burst from the waiting women as
the young man flung the torch directly by the head of the bier. Next the
priests threw more lighted torches alongside the corpse, followed by more oil.
The flames licked tentatively around the edges of the wood, then burst across
the top of the pyre. The fire swirled around the woman, and in an instant her
oil-soaked robes flared, enveloping her body and igniting her hair. Hawksworth
saw her open her mouth and say something, words he did not understand, and then
the pain overcame her and she screamed and tried frantically to move toward the
edge of the pit. As she reached the edge she saw the hovering priests, waiting
with long poles to push her away, and she stumbled backward. Her last screams
were drowned by the chorus of wailing women as she collapsed across the body of
her husband, a human torch.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth stepped back in horror and whirled on Vasant Rao,
who stood watching impassively.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;This is murder! Is this more of your Rajput
'tradition&quot;?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It is what we call <i>sati</i>, when a brave woman
joins her husband in death. Did you hear what she said? She pronounced the
words 'five, two' as the life-spirit left her. At the moment of death we
sometimes have the gift of prophecy. She was saying this is the fifth time she
has burned herself with the same husband, and that only two times more are
required to release her from the cycle of birth and death, to render her a
perfect being.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I can't believe she burned herself willingly.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Of course she did. Rajput women are noble. It was the
way she honored her husband, and her caste. It was her <i>dharma</i>.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth stared again at the pit. Priests were throwing
more oil on the raging flames, which already had enveloped the two bodies and
now licked around the edges, almost at Hawksworth's feet. The five women seemed
crazed with grief, as they held hands and moved along the edge in a delirious
dance. The heat had become intense, and Hawksworth instinctively stepped back
as tongues of fire licked over the edge of the pit. The mourning women appeared
heedless of their own danger as they continued to circle, their light cloth
robes now only inches from the flame. The air was filled with the smell of
death and burning flesh.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>They must be mad with grief. They'll catch their clothes . .
.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>At that instant the hem of one of the women's robes ignited.
She examined the whipping flame with a wild, empty gaze, almost as though not
seeing it. Then she turned on the other women, terror and confusion in her
eyes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth was already peeling off his jerkin. He'd seen</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>enough fires
on the gun deck to know the man whose clothes caught always panicked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>If I can reach her in time I can smother the robe before
she's burned and maimed. Her legs . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Before he could move, the woman suddenly turned and poised
herself at the edge of the roaring pit. She emitted one long intense wail, then
threw herself directly into the fire. At that moment the robes of a second
woman caught, and she too turned and plunged head-first into the flames.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Merciful God! What are they doing!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The three remaining women paused for a moment. Then they
clasped hands, and, as though on a private signal, plunged over the edge into
the inferno, their hair and robes igniting like dry tinder in a furnace. The
women all clung together as the flames enveloped them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth tried to look again into the pit, but turned away
in revulsion.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What in hell is happening?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Vasant Rao's eyes were flooded with disbelief.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;They must have been his concubines. Or his other wives.
Only his first wife was allowed to have the place of honor beside his body.
I've. . .&quot; The Rajput struggled for composure. &quot;I've never seen so
many women die in a <i>sati</i>. It's . . .&quot; He seemed unable to find
words. &quot;It's almost too much.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;How did such a murderous custom begin?&quot;
Hawksworth's eyes were seared now from the smoke and the smell of burning
flesh. &quot;It's unworthy of humanity.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We believe aristocratic Rajput women have always wished
to do it. To honor their brave warriors. The Moghul has tried to stop it,
however. He claims it began only a few centuries ago, when a Rajput raja
suspected the women in his palace were trying to poison him and his ministers.
Some believe the raja decreed that custom as protection for his own life, and
then others followed. But I don't think that's true. I believe women in India
have always done it, from ancient times. But what does it matter when it began.
Now all rani, the wives of rajas, follow their husbands in death, and consider
it a great honor. Today it seems his other women also insisted on joining her.
I think it was against her wishes. She did not want to share her moment of
glory. <i>Sati</i> is a noble custom, Captain Hawksworth, part of that Rajput
strength of character wanting in other races.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>A hand seized Hawksworth's arm roughly and jerked him back
through the crowd, a sea of eyes burning with contempt. Amid the drifting smoke
he caught a glimpse of the bullock carts of the caravan, lined along the far
end of the road leading into the fortress. The drivers were nowhere to be seen,
but near the carts were cattle sheds for the bullocks.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>If they can send innocent women to their death, life means
nothing here. They'll kill us for sure.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He turned to Vasant Rao, whose face showed no trace of fear.
The Rajput seemed oblivious to the smell of death as smoke from the fire
engulfed the palms that lined the village roads. They were approaching the
porch of the great house where the head of the dynasty had lived.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Two guards shoved Hawksworth roughly to his knees. He looked
up to see, standing on the porch of the house, the young man who had tossed the
torch into the pit. He began speaking to them, in the tones of an announcement.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;He's the son of the man you killed. He has claimed
leadership of the dynasty, and calls himself Raj Singh.&quot; Vasant Rao
translated rapidly, as the man continued speaking. &quot;He says that tomorrow
there will be an eclipse of the sun here. It is predicted in the Panjika, the
Hindu manual of astrology. His father, the leader of this dynasty of the sun,
has died, and tomorrow the sun will die also for a time. The Brahmins have said
it is fitting that you die with it. For high castes in India the death of the
sun is an evil time, a time when the two great powers of the sky are in
conflict. On the day of an eclipse no fires are lit in our homes. Food is
discarded and all open earthenware pots are smashed. No one who wears the
sacred thread of the twice-born can be out of doors during an eclipse. The
Brahmin astrologers have judged it is the proper time for you to pay for your
cowardly act. You will be left on a pike to die in the center of the
square.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth drew himself up, his eyes still smarting from</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>the smoke,
and tried to fix the man's eyes. Then he spoke, in a voice he hoped would carry
to all the waiting crowd.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Tell him his Brahmin astrologers know not the truth,
neither past nor future.&quot; Hawksworth forced himself to still the tremble in
his voice. &quot;There will be no eclipse tomorrow. His Brahmins, who cannot
foretell the great events in the heavens, should have no right to work their
will on earth.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Have you gone mad?&quot; Vasant Rao turned and glared
at him as he spat the words in disgust. &quot;Why not try to die with
dignity.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Tell him.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Vasant Rao stared at Hawksworth in dumb amazement. &quot;Do
you think we're all fools. The eclipse is foretold in the Panjika. It is the
sacred book of the Brahmins. It's used to pick auspicious days for ceremonies,
for weddings, for planting crops. Eclipses are predicted many years ahead in
the Panjika. They have been forecast in India for centuries. Don't Europeans
know an eclipse is a meeting of the sun and moon? Nothing can change
that.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Tell him what I said. Exactly.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Vasant Rao hesitated for a few moments and then reluctantly
translated. The Rajput chieftain's face did not change and his reply was curt.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Vasant Rao turned to Hawksworth. &quot;He says you are a fool
as well as an Untouchable.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Tell him that if I am to die with the sun, he must kill
me now. I spit on his Brahmins and their Panjika. I say the eclipse will be
this very day. In less than three hours.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;In one <i>pahar</i>?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Yes.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;No god, and certainly no man, can control such things.
Why tell him this invention?&quot; Vasant Rao's voice rose with his anger.
&quot;When this thing does not happen, you will die in even greater
dishonor.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Tell him.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Vasant Rao again translated, his voice hesitant. Raj Singh
examined Hawksworth skeptically. Then he turned and spoke to one of the tall
Rajputs standing nearby, who walked to the end of the porch and summoned
several Brahmin priests. After a conference marked by much angry shouting and
gesturing, one of the Brahmins turned and left. Moments later he reappeared
carrying a book.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;They have consulted the Panjika again.&quot; Vasant Rao
pointed toward the book as one of the Brahmins directed a stream of language at
Raj Singh. &quot;He says there is no mistaking the date of the eclipse, and the
time. It is in the lunar month of Asvina, which is your September-October. Here
in the Deccan the month begins and ends with the full moon. The <i>tithi</i> or
lunar day of the eclipse begins tomorrow.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As Hawksworth listened, he felt his heart begin to race.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The calculations at the observatory had a lot to say about
your Panjika's lunar calendar. And they showed how unwieldy it is compared to
the solar calendar the Arabs and Europeans use. A cycle of the moon doesn't
divide evenly into the days in a year. So your astrologers have to keep adding
and subtracting days and months to keep years the same length. It's almost
impossible to relate a lunar calendar accurately to a solar year. Jamshid Beg,
the astronomer from Samarkand, loved to check out the predictions in the Hindu
Panjika.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>If I deciphered his calculations right, this is one eclipse
the Panjika called wrong. The astrologer must have miscopied his calculations.
Or maybe he just bungled one of the main rules of lunar bookkeeping. Solar days
begin at sunrise, but lunar days are different. The moon can rise at any time
of day. According to the system, the lunar day current at sunrise is supposed
to be the day that's counted. But if the moon rises just after sunrise, and
sets before sunrise the next day, then that whole lunar &quot;day&quot; has to
be dropped from the count.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Today was one of those days. It should have been dropped from
the lunar calendar, but it wasn't. So the prediction in the Panjika is a day
off.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>According to Jamshid Beg's calculations, at least. God help
me if he was wrong.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>      
&quot;Tell him his Panjika is false. If I'm to be killed the day of the
eclipse, he must kill me now, today.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>       Raj
Singh listened with increasing disquiet as Vasant Rao translated. He glanced
nervously at the Brahmins and then replied in a low voice.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>      
Vasant Rao turned to Hawksworth. &quot;He asks what proof you have of your
forecast?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>      
Hawksworth looked around. What proof could there be of an impending eclipse?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>      
&quot;My word is my word.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>      
Another exchange followed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>      
&quot;He is most doubtful you are wiser than the Panjika.&quot; Vasant Rao
paused for a moment, then continued. &quot;I am doubtful as well. He says that
if you have invented a lie you are very foolish. And we will all soon
know.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>      
&quot;Tell him he can believe as he chooses. The eclipse will be today.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>        Again
there was an exchange. Then Vasant Rao turned to Hawksworth, a mystified
expression on his face.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>      
&quot;He says if what you say is true, then you are an <i>avatar</i>, the
incarnation of a god. If the eclipse is today, as you say, then the village must
begin to prepare immediately. People must all move indoors. Once more, is what
you say true?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>      
&quot;It's true.&quot; Hawksworth strained to keep his voice confident, and his
eyes on the Rajput chieftain as he spoke. &quot;It doesn't matter whether he
believes or not.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>       Raj
Singh consulted again with the Brahmin priests, who had now gathered around.
They shifted nervously, and several spat to emphasize their skepticism. Then
the Rajput leader returned and spoke again to Vasant Rao.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>      
&quot;He says that he will take the precaution of ordering the high castes
indoors. If what you say comes to pass, then you have saved the village from a
great harm.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>       
Hawksworth started to speak but Vasant Rao silenced him with a gesture.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>       
&quot;He also says that if what you say is a lie, he will not wait until
tomorrow to kill you. You will be buried alive at sunset today, up to the
throat. Then you will be stoned to death by the women and children of the
village. It is the death of criminal Untouchables.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As the smoke from the funeral pyre continued to drift through
the village, the high-caste men and women entered their homes and sealed their
doors. Women took their babies in their laps and began their prayers. Only low
castes and children too young to wear the sacred thread remained outside. Even
Vasant Rao was allowed to return to the room where they had been held prisoner.
Hawksworth suddenly found himself without guards, and he wandered back to the
square to look once more at the pit where the funeral pyre had been. All that
remained of the bodies were charred skeletons.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>An hour ago there was life. Now there's death. The difference
is the will to live.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>And luck. The turn of chance.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

Prince Jadar passed the signal to the waiting guards as he strode briskly down
the stone-floored hallway and they nodded imperceptibly in acknowledgment.
There was no sound in the torch-lit corridor save the pad of his leather-soled
riding slippers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It was the beginning of the third <i>pahar</i>, midday, and
he had come directly from the hunt when the runner brought word that Mumtaz had
entered labor. It would have been unseemly to have gone to her side, so he had
spoken briefly with the <i>dai</i>, midwife. He had overruled the Hindu woman's
suggestion that Mumtaz be made to give birth squatting by a bed, so that a
broom could be pressed against her abdomen as the midwife rubbed her back. It
was, he knew, the barbarous practice of unbelievers, and he cursed himself for
taking on the woman in the first place. It had been a symbolic gesture for the
Hindu troops, to quell concern that all the important details attending the
birth would be Muslim. Jadar had insisted that Mumtaz be moved to a velvet mat
on the floor of her room and carefully positioned with her head north and her
feet south. In case she should die in childbirth—and he fervently prayed she
would not—this was the position in which she would be buried, her face directed
toward Mecca. He had ordered all cannon of the fort primed with powder, to be
fired in the traditional Muslim salute if a male child was the issue.</span></p>

had prayed for many days that this time a son would be named. There were two
daughters already, and yet another would merely mean one more intriguing woman

marry. The complications of yet another aspiring family in the palace circle
were inconceivable. The scheming Persian Shi'ites, like the queen and her
family, who had descended on Agra would like nothing better than another
opportunity to use marriage to dilute the influence of Sunni Muslims at court.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Allah, this time it has to be a son. Hasn't everything
possible been done? And if Akman was right, that a change of residence during
the term ensures a male heir, then I'll have a son twelve times over from this
birthing. She's been in a dozen cities. And camps. I even tested the augury of
the Hindus and had a household snake killed and tossed in the air by one of
their Brahmin unbelievers, to see how it would land. And it landed on its back,
which they say augurs a boy. Also, the milk squeezed from her breasts three
days ago was thin, which the Hindus believe foretells a son.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Still, the omens have been mixed. <i>The eclipse</i>. Why did
it come a day earlier than the Hindu astrologers had predicted? Now I realize
it was exactly seven days before the birth. No one can recall when they failed
to compute an eclipse correctly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>What did it mean? That my line will die out? Or that a son
will be born here who will one day overshadow me?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Who can know the future? What Allah wills must be.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>And, he told himself, the meeting set for the third <i>pahar</i>
must still take place, regardless of the birth. Unless he did what he had
planned, the birth would be meaningless. All the years of planning now could be
forfeited in this single campaign.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>If I fail now, what will happen to the legacy of Akman, his
great work to unify India? Will India return to warring fiefdoms, neighbor
pitted against neighbor, or fall to the Shi'ites? The very air around me hints
of treachery.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>With that thought he momentarily inspected the placement of
his personal crest on the thick wooden door of the fortress reception hall and
pushed it wide. A phalanx of guards trailed behind him into the room, which he
had claimed as his command post for the duration of his stay in Burhanpur. The
immense central carpet had been freshly garlanded around the edges with
flowers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The fortress, the only secure post remaining in the city, had
been commandeered by Jadar and his hand-picked guard. His officers had taken
accommodations in the town, and the troops had erected an enormous tent complex
along the road leading into the city from the north. Their women now swarmed
over the bazaar, accumulating stores for the march south. Bullock carts of
fresh produce glutted the roads leading into the city, for word had reached the
surrounding villages that Burhanpur was host to the retinue of the prince and
his soldiers from the north—buyers accustomed to high northern prices. The
villagers also knew from long experience that a wise man would strip his fields
and gardens and orchards now and sell, before an army on the march simply took
what it wanted.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Rumors had already reached the city that the army of Malik
Ambar, Abyssinian leader of the Deccanis, was marching north toward Burhanpur
with eighty thousand infantry and horsemen. An advance contingent was already
encamped no more than ten <i>kos</i> south of the city.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Jadar inspected the reception room until he was certain</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>it was
secure, with every doorway under command of his men. Then he signaled the
leader of the Rajput guard, who relayed a message to a courier waiting outside.
Finally he settled himself against an immense velvet bolster, relishing this
moment of quiet to clear his mind.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The Deccan, the central plains of India. Will they ever be
ours? How many more campaigns must there be?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He recalled with chagrin all the humiliations dealt Arangbar
by the Deccanis.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>When Arangbar took the throne at Akman's death, he had
announced he would continue his father's policy of military control of the
Deccan. A general named Ghulam Adl had requested, and received, confirmation of
his existing post of Khan Khanan, &quot;Khan of Khans,&quot; the supreme
commander of the Moghul armies in the south. To subdue the Deccan once and for
all, Arangbar had sent an additional twelve thousand cavalry south and had given
Ghulam Adl a million rupees to refurbish his army. But in spite of these
forces, the Abyssinian Malik Ambar soon had set up a rebel capital at
Ahmadnagar and declared himself prime minister.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>In disgust Arangbar had taken the command from Ghulam Adl and
given it to his own son, the second oldest, Parwaz. This dissolute prince
marched south with great pomp. Once there he set up an extravagant military
headquarters, a royal court in miniature, and spent several years drinking and
bragging of his inevitable victory. Ghulam Adl had watched this with growing
resentment, and finally he succumbed to bribes by Malik Ambar and retreated
with his own army.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>In anger Arangbar then appointed two other generals to march
on the Deccan, one from the north and one from the West, hoping to trap Malik
Ambar in a pincer. But the Abyssinian deftly kept them apart, and badly
defeated each in turn. Eventually both were driven back to the north, with
heavy losses.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>This time, on the advice of Queen Janahara, Arangbar
transferred his son Parwaz out of the Deccan, to Allahbad, and in his place
sent Prince Jadar. The younger prince had marched on the Deccan with forty
thousand additional troops to supplement the existing forces.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>When Jadar and his massive army reached Burhanpur, Malik
Ambar wisely proposed a truce and negotiations. He returned the fort at
Ahmadnagar to the Moghul and withdrew his troops. Arangbar was jubilant and
rewarded Jadar with sixteen <i>lakhs</i> of rupees and a prize diamond.
Triumphant, Jadar had returned to Agra and begun to think of becoming the next
Moghul. That had been three long years ago.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But Malik Ambar had the cunning of a jackal, and his
&quot;surrender&quot; had been merely a ruse to remove the Moghul troops again
to the north. This year he had waited for the monsoon, when conventional armies
could not move rapidly, and again risen in rebellion, easily driving Ghulam
Adl's army north from Ahmadnagar, reclaiming the city, and laying siege to its
Moghul garrison. The despairing Arangbar again appealed to Jadar to lead troops
south to relieve the permanent forces of Ghulam Adl. After demanding and
receiving a substantial increase in <i>mansab </i>rank and personal cavalry,
Jadar had agreed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The wide wooden door of the reception hall opened and Ghulam
Adl strode regally into the room, wearing a gold- braided turban with a feather
and a great sword at his belt. His beard was longer than Jadar had remembered,
and now it had been reddened with henna—perhaps, Jadar thought, to hide the
gray. But his deep-set eyes were still haughty and self-assured, and his
swagger seemed to belie reports he had barely escaped with his life from the
besieged fortress at Ahmadnagar only five weeks before.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Ghulam Adl's gaze quickly swept the room, but his eyes
betrayed no notice of the exceptional size of Jadar's guard. With an immense
show of dignity he nodded a perfunctory bow, hands clasped at the sparkling
jewel of his turban.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Salaam, Highness. May Allah lay His hand on both our
swords and temper them once more with fire.&quot; He seated himself easily, as
he might with an equal, and when no servant came forward, he poured himself a
glass of wine from the decanter that waited on the carpet beside his bolster.
Is there anything, he wondered, I despise more than these presumptuous young
princes from Agra? &quot;I rejoice your journey was swift. You've arrived in
time to witness my army savage the Abyssinian unbeliever and his rabble.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;How many troops are left?&quot; Jadar seemed not to
hear the boast.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Waiting are fifty thousand men, Highness, and twenty
thousand horse, ready to tender their lives at my command.&quot; Ghulam Adl
delicately shielded his beard as he drank off the glass of wine and—when again
no servant appeared— poured himself another.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Jadar remained expressionless.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;My reports give you only five thousand men left, most <i>chelas</i>.
Chelas, from the Hindu slang for &quot;slave,&quot; was a reference to the
mercenary troops, taken in childhood and raised in the camp, that commanders
maintained as a kernel of their forces. Unlike soldiers from the villages, they
were loyal even in misfortune, because they literally had no place to return
to. &quot;What troops do you have from the <i>mansabdars</i>, who've been
granted stipends from their <i>jagir</i> estate revenue to maintain men and
horse?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Those were the ones I mean, Highness.&quot; Ghulam
Adl's hand trembled slightly as he again lifted the wineglass. &quot;The <i>mansabdars</i>
have assured me we have only to sound the call, and their men will muster. In
due time.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then pay is not in arrears for their men and
cavalry.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Highness, it's well known pay must always be in arrears.
How else are men's loyalties to be guaranteed? A commander foolish enough to
pay his troops on time will lose them at the slightest setback, since they have
no reason to remain with him in adversity.&quot; Ghulam Adl eased his wineglass
on the carpet and bent forward. &quot;I concede some of the <i>mansabdars</i> 
may have allowed matters of pay to slip longer than is wise. But they assure me
that when the time is right their men will muster nonetheless.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then why not call the muster? In another twenty days
Ambar's troops will be encamped at our doorstep. He could well control all
lands south of the Narbada River.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>And that, Ghulam Adl smiled to himself, is precisely the
plan.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He thought of the arrangement that had been worked out. Jadar
was to be kept in Burhanpur for another three weeks, delayed by any means
possible. By then Malik Ambar would have the city surrounded, all access cut
off. The Imperial troops would be isolated and demoralized. No troops would be
forthcoming from the <i>mansabdars</i>. Only promises of troops. Cut off from
Agra and provisions, Jadar would have no choice but to sign a treaty. The paper
had already been prepared. Malik Ambar would rule the Deccan from his new
capital at Ahmadnagar, and Ghulam Adl would be appointed governor of all
provinces north from Ahmadnagar to the Narbada River. With their combined
troops holding the borders, no Moghul army could ever again challenge the
Deccan. Ghulam Adl knew the <i>mansabdars</i> would support him, because he had
offered to cut their taxes in half. He had neglected to specify for how long.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I respectfully submit the time for muster is premature,
Highness. Crops are not yet in. The revenues of the <i>mansabdars'</i> <i>jagir</i>
estates will suffer if men are called now.&quot; Ghulam Adl shifted
uncomfortably.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;They'll have no revenues at all if they don't muster
immediately. I'll confiscate the <i>jagir</i> of any <i>mansabdar</i> who has
not mustered his men and cavalry within seven days.&quot; Jadar watched Ghulam
Adl's throat muscles tense, and he asked himself if a <i>jagir</i> granted by
the Moghul could be legally confiscated. Probably not. But the threat would
serve to reveal loyalties, and reveal them quickly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But there's no possible way to pay the men now,
Highness.&quot; Ghulam Adl easily retained his poise. Hold firm and this
aspiring young upstart will waver and then agree. Give him numbers. First make
it sound hopeless, then show him a way he can still win. &quot;There's not
enough silver in all the Deccan. Let me give you some idea of the problem.
Assume it would require a year's back pay to muster the troops, not
unreasonable since most of the <i>mansabdars</i> are at least two years behind
now. The usual yearly allowance for cavalry here is three hundred rupees for a
Muslim and two hundred and forty for a Hindu. You will certainly need to raise
a minimum of thirty thousand men from the <i>mansabdars</i>. Assuming some
loyal troops might possibly muster on notes of promise, you'd still need almost
fifty <i>lakhs</i> of rupees. An impossible sum. It's clear the <i>mansabdars</i>
won't have the revenues to pay their men until the fall crops are
harvested.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then I'll confiscate their <i>jagirs</i> now and pay
the troops myself. And deduct the sum from their next revenues.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That's impossible. The money is nowhere to be
found.&quot; Ghulam Adl realized with relief that Jadar was bluffing; the
prince could not possibly raise the money needed. He shifted closer and smiled
warmly. &quot;But listen carefully. If we wait but two months, everything will
be changed. Then it'll be simple to squeeze the revenue from the <i>mansabdars</i>,
and we can pay the men ourselves if we need. Until then we can easily contain
the Abyssinian and his rabble. Perhaps we could raise a few men and horse from
the <i>mansabdars</i> now, but frankly I advise against it. Why trouble them
yet? With the troops we have we can keep Malik Ambar diverted for weeks, months
even. Then when the time is right we sound the call, march south with our
combined forces, and drive him into the southern jungles forever.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But that call will raise no men, Ghulam Adl told himself, not
a single wagon driver. It has been agreed. &quot;We'll wait a few weeks until
Ambar has his supply lines extended. Then we'll begin to harass him. In no time
he'll begin to fall back to Ahmadnagar to wait for winter. And by that time
we'll have our full strength. We'll march in force and crush him. I'll lead the
men personally. You need never leave Burhanpur, Highness.&quot; He took another
sip of wine. &quot;Though I daresay its pleasures must seem rustic for one
accustomed to the more luxurious diversions of Agra.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Jadar examined the commander and a slight, knowing smile
played across his lips. &quot;Let me propose a slight alternative.&quot; He
began evenly. &quot;I will lead the army this time, and you will remain here at
the fortress. I called you here today to notify you that as of this moment you are
relieved of your command and confined to the fort.&quot; Jadar watched Ghulam
Adl stiffen and his sly grin freeze on his face. &quot;I will assemble the army
myself and march south in ten days.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;This is a weak jest, Highness.&quot; Ghulam Adl tried
to laugh. &quot;No one knows the Deccan the way I and my commanders know it.
The terrain is treacherous.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Your knowledge of the terrain admittedly is excellent.
You and your commanders have retreated the length of the Deccan year after
year. This time I will use my own generals. Abdullah Khan will command the
advance guard, with three thousand horse from our own troops. Abul Hasan will
take the left flank, and Raja Vikramajit the right. I will personally command
the center.&quot; Jadar fixed Ghulam Adl squarely. &quot;You will be confined
to the fort, where you'll send no ciphers to Ambar. Your remaining troops will
be divided and put under our command. You will order it in writing today and I
will send the dispatches.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;For your sake I trust this is a jest, Highness. You
dare not carry it out.&quot; Ghulam Adl slammed his glass onto the carpet,
spilling his wine. The Rajputs around Jadar stiffened but made no move. &quot;I
have the full support of the Moghul himself. Your current position in Agra is
already talked about here in the south. Do you think we're so far away we hear
nothing? Your return this time, if you are allowed to return, will be nothing
like the grand celebrations three years ago. If I were you, I'd be marching
back now. Leave the Deccan to those who know it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You're right about Agra on one point. It is far away.
And this campaign is mine, not the Moghul’s.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You'll never raise the troops, young prince: Only I can
induce the <i>mansabdars</i> to muster.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'll muster the men. With full pay.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You'll muster nothing, Highness. You'll be Ambar's
prisoner inside a month. I can swear it. If you are still alive.&quot; Ghulam
Adl bowed low and his hand shot for his sword. By the time it touched the
handle the Rajputs were there. He was circled by drawn blades. Jadar watched
impassively for a moment, and then signaled the guards to escort Ghulam Adl
from the audience room.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'll see you dead.&quot; He shouted over his shoulder
as the men dragged him toward the door. &quot;Within the month.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Jadar watched Ghulam Adl's turban disappear through the
torchlit opening and down the corridor. His sword remained on the carpet, where
it had been removed by the Rajput guards. Jadar stared at it for a moment,
admiring the silver trim along the handle, and it reminded him of the silver
shipment. And the Englishman.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Vasant Rao blundered badly with the English captain. He
should have found a way to disarm him in advance. Always disarm a <i>feringhi</i>.
Their instincts are too erratic. The whole scenario fell apart after he killed
the headman of the dynasty. My Rajput games almost became a war.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But what happened in the village? Did the <i>feringhi</i>
work sorcery? Why was the caravan released so suddenly? The horsemen I had
massed in the valley, in case of an emergency, panicked after the eclipse
began. They became just so many terrified Hindus. Then suddenly the caravan
assembled and left, with Rajputs from the village riding guard, escorting them
all the way back to the river.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>And even now Vasant Rao refuses to talk about what really
happened. It seems his honor is too besmirched. He refuses even to eat with the
other men.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Allah the Merciful. Rajputs and their cursed honor.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But I've learned what I need to know about the English <i>feringhi</i>.
His nerve is astonishing. How could he dare refuse to attend my morning durbar
audience in the reception room? Should I accept his claim that he's an
ambassador and therefore I should come to him. Should I simply have him brought
before me?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>No. I have a better idea. But tomorrow. After the child is
born and I've sent runners to the <i>mansabdars</i> . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>A member of Mumtaz's guard burst through the doorway, then
remembered himself and salaamed deeply to the prince. Guards around Jadar
already had their swords half drawn.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Forgive a fool, Highness.&quot; He fell to his knees,
just in case. &quot;I'm ordered to report that your son is born. The <i>dai</i>
says he's perfectly formed and has the lungs of a cavalry commander.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Cheers swept the room, and the air blossomed with flying
turbans. Jadar motioned the terrified man closer and he nervously knelt again,
this time directly before Jadar.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The <i>dai</i> respectfully asks if it would please
Your Highness to witness the cord-cutting ceremony. She suggests a gold knife,
instead of the usual silver.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Jadar barely heard the words, but he did recall that
tradition allowed the midwife to keep the knife.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;She can have her knife of gold, and you are granted a
thousand gold <i>mohurs</i>. But the cord will be cut with a string.&quot; This
ceremony must be a signal to all India, Jadar told himself, and he tried to
recall exactly the tradition started by Akman for newborn Moghul princes. The
birth cord of all Akman's three sons was cut with a silken string, then placed
in a velvet bag with writings from the Quran, and kept under the new child's
pillow for forty days.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The guard salaamed once more, his face in the carpet, and
then scurried toward the door, praising Allah. As Jadar rose and made his way
toward the corridor, a chant of &quot;Jadar-o-Akbar,&quot; &quot;Jadar is
Great,&quot; rose from the cheering Rajputs. Every man knew that with an heir,
the prince was at last ready to claim his birthright. And they would fight
beside him for it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Mumtaz lay against a bolster, a fresh scarf tied around her
head and a roller bound about her abdomen, taking a draft of strong,
garlic-scented asafetida gum as Jadar came into the room. He immediately knew
she was well, for this anti-cold precaution was taken only after the placenta
was expelled and the mother's well-being assured. Next to her side was a box of
betel leaves, rolled especially with myrrh to purge the taste of the asafetida.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;My congratulations, Highness.&quot; The <i>dai</i>
salaamed awkwardly from the bedside. &quot;May it please you to know the child
is blind of an eye.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Jadar stared at her dumbfounded, then remembered she was a
local Hindu midwife, from Gujarat province, where the birth of a boy is never
spoken of, lest the gods grow jealous of the parents' good fortune and loose
the Evil Eye. Instead, boys were announced by declaring the child blind in one
eye. No precautions against divine jealousy were thought necessary for a girl
child, a financial liability no plausible god would covet.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The <i>dai</i> returned to washing Mumtaz's breasts, stroking
them carefully with wet blades of grass. Jadar knew this local ritual was
believed to ensure fortune for the child and he did not interrupt. He merely
returned Mumtaz's weak smile and strode to the silver basin resting by the
bedside, where another midwife was washing his new son in a murky mixture of
gram flour and water.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The frightened woman dried off the child, brushed his head
with perfumed oil, and placed him on a thin pillow of quilted calico for Jadar
to see. He was red and wrinkled and his dark eyes were startled. But he was a
prince. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Jadar touched the infant's warm hand as he examined him for
imperfections. There were none.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Someday, my first son, you may rule India as Moghul. If we
both live that long.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Is he well?&quot; Mumtaz spoke at last, her normally
shrill voice now scarcely above a whisper. &quot;Are you pleased?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;He'll do for now.&quot; Jadar smiled as he examined her
tired face. She had never seemed as beautiful as she did at this moment. He
knew there was no way he could ever show his great love for her, but he knew
she understood. And returned it. &quot;Do these unbelievers know enough to
follow Muslim tradition?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Yes. A mullah has been summoned to sound the <i>azan</i>,
the call to prayer, in his ear.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But a male child must first be announced with
artillery. So he'll never be afraid to fight.&quot; Jadar wasn't sure how much
belief he put in all these Muslim traditions, but the troops expected it and
every ceremony for this prince had to be observed. Lest superstitions begin
that he was somehow ill-fated. Superstitions are impossible to bury. &quot;This
one is a prince. He will be greeted with cannon. Then I'll immediately have his
horoscope cast—for the Hindu troops—and schedule his naming ceremony—for the
Believers.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What will you name him?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;His first name will be Nushirvan. You can pick the
others.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Nushirvan was a haughty Persian king. And it's an ugly
name.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It's the name I've chosen.&quot; Jadar smiled wickedly,
still mulling over what name he would eventually pick.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Mumtaz did not argue. She had already selected the name
Salaman, the handsome young man Persian legends said was once created by a wise
magician. Salaman was an ideal lover. Whatever name Jadar chose, Salaman would
be his second name. And the one she would call him all the coming years in the <i>zenana</i>,
when he would creep into her bed after Jadar had departed for his own quarters.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>And we'll see what name he answers to seven years hence, on
his circumcision day.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The <i>dai </i>was busy spooning a mixture of honey, ghee,
and opium into the child's mouth. Then a drop of milk was pressed from Mumtaz's
breast and rubbed on the breast of the wet nurse. Jadar watched the ritual with
approval. Now for the most important tradition, the one begun by Akman.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Is the wrap ready?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Akman had believed that the first clothes a Moghul prince
wore should be fashioned from an old garment of a Muslim holy man, and he had
requested a garment from the revered Sayyid Ali Shjirazi for his first son. The
custom had become fixed for the royal family.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It's here. The woman in Surat heard a child was due and
had this sent to me in Agra before we left.&quot; She pointed to a folded
loincloth, which had been washed to a perfect white. &quot;It was once worn by
that Sufi you adore, Samad.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Good. I'm glad it's from Samad. But what woman in Surat
do you mean?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You know who she is.&quot; Mumtaz looked around the
crowded room, and switched from Turki to Persian. &quot;She sent the weekly
reports of Mukarrab Khan's affairs, and handled all the payments to those who
collected information in Surat.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Jadar nodded almost imperceptibly. &quot;That one. Of course
I remember her. Her reports were always more reliable than the Shahbandar's. I
find I can never trust any number that thief gives me. I always have to ask
myself what he would wish it to be, and then adjust. But what happened to her?
I learned a month ago that Mukarrab Khan was being sent to Goa. I think a
certain woman of power in Agra finally realized I was learning everything that
went on at the port before she was, and thought Mukarrab Khan had betrayed
her.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The Surat woman didn't go to Goa with Mukarrab Khan.
She made him divorce her. It was a scandal.&quot; Mumtaz smiled mysteriously.
&quot;You should come to the women's quarters more often, and learn the news.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But what happened to her?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;There's a rumor in Surat that the Shahbandar, Mirza
Nuruddin, is hiding her in the women's quarters of his estate house. But
actually she left for Agra the next day, by the northern road. I'm very worried
what may happen to her there.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;How do you know all this? It sounds like bazaar
gossip.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It's all true enough. She sent a pigeon, to the
fortress here. The message was waiting when we arrived.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It's good she's out of Surat. With Mukarrab Khan gone,
she's no longer any help there. But I've always wanted to thank her somehow.
She's one of the best. And our only woman. I don't think anyone ever guessed
what she really did.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I will thank her for you. Her message was a request.
Something only I could arrange. A favor for a favor.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And what was that?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Just something between women, my love. Nothing to do
with armies and wars.&quot; Mumtaz shifted on the bolster and took a perfumed
pan. &quot;Allah, I'm tired.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Jadar studied her face again, marveling as always how it
seemed to attest to her spirit.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then rest. I hope the cannon won't disturb you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It should have been another girl. Then there'd be no
cannon.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And no heir.&quot; Jadar turned to leave and Mumtaz
eased herself back on the bolster. Then she lifted herself again and called
Jadar.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Who is escorting the English <i>feringhi</i> to
Agra?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Unfortunately it's Vasant Rao. And just when I need
him. But he demanded to do it personally.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm glad.&quot; Mumtaz smiled weakly. &quot;Have him
see one of my servants before they leave.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Why should I bother him with that?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;To humor me.&quot; She paused. &quot;Is this <i>feringhi</i>
handsome?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Why do you ask?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;A woman's curiosity.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I haven't seen him yet. I do suspect he's quick.
Perhaps too quick. But I'll find out more tomorrow. And then I'll decide what I
have to do.&quot; Jadar paused at the doorway, while the dai pulled aside the
curtains that had been newly hung. &quot;Sleep. And watch over my new prince.
He's our first victory in the Deccan. I pray to Allah he's not our last.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He turned and was gone. Minutes later the cannon salutes
began.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>       
Hawksworth began to count the stone stairs after the third twisting turn of the
descending corridor, and his eyes searched through the smoke and flickering
torchlight for some order in the arched doorways that opened out on each level
as they went farther and farther down. Ail object struck him across the face
and his hand plunged for his sword, before he remembered he had left it in his
quarters, on Jadar's command. Then he heard the high-pitched shriek of a bat
and saw it flutter into the shadows. The torchbearers were ten Rajputs of
Jadar's personal guard, armed with the usual swords and half-pikes. None spoke
as their footsteps clattered through the musty subterranean air.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth felt the dankness against the beads of sweat forming
on his skin. As the old memory of a dark prison welled up, he suddenly realized
he was terrified.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Why did I agree to meet him here? This is not &quot;the lower
level of the fortress.&quot; This is a dungeon. But he can't detain me, not
with a safe conduct pass from the Moghul.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Still, he might try. If he wants to keep me out of Agra while
he's away on campaign. And he may. I already smell this campaign is doomed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It was the evening of Hawksworth's third day in the Burhanpur
fortress. When the convoy arrived at the village of Bahadurpur, three <i>kos</i>
west of Burhanpur, they had been met by Jadar's personal guards and escorted
through the city and into the walled compound of the fortress. He had been
given spacious, carpeted quarters, always guarded, and had seen no one, not
even Vasant Rao. Communications with Jadar had been by courier, and finally
they had agreed on a neutral meeting place. Jadar had suggested a location in
the palace where they would have privacy, yet be outside his official quarters.
Since they would meet as officials of state, Jadar had insisted on no weapons.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>No visible weapons, Hawksworth told himself, glad he wore
boots.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The corridor narrowed slightly, then ended abruptly at a
heavy wooden door. Iron braces were patterned over the face of the door and in
its center was a small window, secured with heavy bars. Armed Rajputs stood on
either side and as Hawksworth's party approached they snapped about, hands at
their swords. Then the leader of Hawksworth's guards spoke through the
smoke-filled air, his voice echoing off the stone walls.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Krishna plays his flute.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>A voice came from the sentries at the door.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And longing <i>gopis</i> burn.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Again Hawksworth's guard.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;With a maid's desire.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Immediately the sentries slid back the ancient iron bolt that
spanned the face of the door. Then came the rasping</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>scrape of
another bolt on the inside being released. When he heard the sound, Hawksworth
felt a surge of fear and stared around wildly at the faces of the guards. They
all stood menacingly, with a regal bearing and expressionless faces. Each man
had his hand loosely on his sword.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The door creaked slowly inward, and Hawksworth realized it
was almost a foot thick and probably weighed tons. The guards motioned him
forward and stood stiffly waiting for him to move. He calculated his chances
one more time, and with a shrug, walked through.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The room was enormous, with a high vaulted stone ceiling and
a back wall lost in its smoky recesses. Rows of oil lamps trailed down the
walls on either side of the door. The walls themselves were heavy gray blocks
of cut stone, carefully smoothed until they fit seamlessly together without
mortar. He asked himself how air reached the room, then he traced the lamp
smoke upward and noticed it disappeared through ornate carvings that decorated
the high roof of the chamber.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>A heavy slam echoed off the walls and he turned to see the
door had been sealed. As his eyes adjusted to the lamplight he searched the
chamber. All he could see were long, neat rows of bundles, lining the length of
the stone floor. With a shock he realized they were the bundles from the
caravan. Otherwise the room seemed empty.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>At that moment he caught a flicker of movement, a tall figure
at the far end of the chamber, passing shadowlike among the bundles, an
apparition. Then a voice sounded through the dense air.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;At last we meet.&quot; The stone walls threw back an
eerie echo. &quot;Is the place to your liking?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I prefer sunlight.&quot; Hawksworth felt the cool of
the room envelop his skin. &quot;Where I can see who I'm talking to.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You are speaking to Prince Shapur Firdawsi Jadar, third
son of the Moghul. It's customary to salaam, Captain- General Hawksworth.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I speak for His Majesty, King James the First of
England. The sons of kings normally bow before him.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;When I meet him, perhaps I will bow.&quot; Jadar
emerged from among the bundles. He had an elegant short beard and seemed much
younger, somehow, than Hawksworth had expected. &quot;I'm surprised to see you
alive, Captain. How is it you still live while so many of my Rajputs died?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I live by my wits, not by my caste.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Jadar roared with genuine delight.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Spoken like a Moghul.&quot; Then he sobered.
&quot;You'd be wise never to say that to a Rajput, however. I often wonder how
an army of Moghul troops would fare against a division of Hindu unbelievers. I
pray to Allah I never find out.&quot; Jadar suddenly slipped a dagger from his
waist and held it loosely, fingering the blade. &quot;<i>Feringhi</i>
Christians would be another matter entirely, however. Did you come unarmed,
Captain, as we agreed?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I did.&quot; Hawksworth stared at the knife in dismay.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Come, Captain, please don't ask me to believe you'd be
such a fool.&quot; Jadar slipped the dagger into his other hand with a quick
twist and tossed it atop one of the bundles. &quot;But this meeting must be
held in trust. I ask that you leave your weapon beside mine.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth hesitated, then slowly reached into his boot and
withdrew a small stiletto, the Portuguese knife left at the observatory. As he
dropped it beside Jadar's weapon, he noticed the prince's knife was missing
half its handle.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Jadar smiled. &quot;You know, Captain, if I killed you here,
now, there would be no witness to the deed, save your Christian God.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Do you plan to try?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I do not 'try' to do anything, Captain.&quot; Jadar
opened his hand to reveal that a dagger remained. It was the other side of his
original knife, which had been two blades fitted to appear as one. &quot;What I
do, Captain, is merely a matter of what I decide to do. Right now I have
serious misgivings about your intentions in India.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Jadar's blade glinted in the lamplight as he moved toward
Hawksworth.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Is this your greeting for any who refuse to
salaam?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth took a step backward toward the door, feinted
toward his boot, and rose with a cocked pistol leveled directly at Jadar.
&quot;What game is this?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The prince exploded with laughter, and before Hawksworth
caught the quick motion of his arm, the knife thudded deeply into the wooden
door behind him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well done, Captain. Very well done.&quot; Jadar beamed
in appreciation. &quot;You are, as I suspected, truly without the smallest
shred of Rajput honor. Put away your pistol. I think we can talk. And by the
way, there are twenty matchlocks trained on you right now.&quot; He waved
toward the vaulted ceiling of the crypt, where dark musket barrels were visible
through slits in the carved decoration. He barked a command in Urdu and the
barrels slowly withdrew.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Why don't we talk about releasing me and my chest to
travel on to Agra.&quot; Hawksworth lowered the pistol, but kept it still
cocked, in his hand.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Agra, you say? Captain, there are already Europeans in
Agra.&quot; Jadar leaned against one of the bundles. &quot;Portuguese. They've
been there many years. How many more Christians can India endure? You infidel
Europeans are beginning to annoy me more than I can tell you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Hawksworth tried to read
Jadar's eyes, remembering Shirin's story of the Persians and Portuguese both
hating the prince.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Tell me about your English ships, Captain.&quot; Jadar
seemed not to hear Hawksworth's question. &quot;Tell me how you defeated the
Portuguese so easily.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;English frigates are better designed than the
Portugals' galleons. And English seamen are better gunners and sailors.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Words, Captain. Easy words. Perhaps the Portuguese
allowed themselves to be defeated. This one time. Waiting for a bigger prize. How
can you know?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Is that what the Portugals say happened?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I asked you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;A well-manned English frigate is the match of any two
galleons.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then how many of your 'frigates' would it take to
blockade the port at Goa?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth saw a small flicker in Jadar's eyes as the prince
waited for the answer. &quot;I think a dozen could do it. If we caught their
fleet in the harbor, before they could put out to sea.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Christians typically exaggerate their strength. How
many would it really take? Five times what you've said? Ten times?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I said it depends on seamanship. And surprise.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Christians always seem to have answers. Particularly
when there is no answer.&quot; Jadar turned and pointed to the stacks of
bundles. &quot;By the way, do you know what the caravan carried, Captain?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I doubt very much it was lead. So it's probably
silver.&quot; Hawksworth marveled at the way Jadar seemed to lead the
conversation, always getting what he wanted before what he wanted had become
obvious. And then quickly moving on.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Your 'probably' is exactly right. And do you know why
it carried silver?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You have a long supply line. You needed to buy supplies
and arms.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I see you don't think like a Moghul after all.&quot;
Jadar moved closer, studying Hawksworth's eyes. &quot;Why bother to buy what I
could easily take? No, my Christian captain, or ambassador, or spy, I needed
men. What is it about human character that allows men to be bought like so many
<i>nautch</i> girls?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Not every man is born to wealth.&quot; Hawksworth
glared directly at Jadar, beginning to find the conversation growing sinister.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And few men are without a price, Captain. I think I
could even find yours if I looked enough for it.&quot; Jadar paused
reflectively for a moment, then continued. &quot;Tell me, should I be pleased
with your presence here?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You have no reason not to be. My only mission here is
to open trade between our kings.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You know your 'mission' has brought about many deaths
since you landed in India. The most recent were the deaths of forty of my best
men.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I didn't order the attack on the caravan. Those men's
lives are on the head of whoever did.&quot; Hawksworth stopped, and as he
looked at Jadar something clicked in his mind. Something about the attack that
had bothered him ever since.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Your caravan was attacked by bandits, Captain. Who
could order them to do anything? But the men I provided as escort gave their
lives protecting you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Those men were murdered. They never had a chance.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth's mind was racing. Suddenly the pieces of the
puzzle began to fall together. Everything fit. Vasant Rao had been too nervous.
He must have known the attack was coming, but not when. It was all a game. Some
deadly serious war game. And none of the other men knew.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But I think I have an idea who did order the
attack.&quot; Hawksworth continued, glaring at Jadar. &quot;And you do
too.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Your Rajputs guards were growing careless, Captain.
They made a foolish mistake. What commander can afford men who make mistakes?
Even if they are Rajputs. All men grow complacent if they are never
tested.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It was vicious.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It was discipline. Security has improved considerably
here since that incident.&quot; Jadar continued evenly, ignoring the look on
Hawksworth's face. &quot;The only real difficulties that night were caused by
you. It was very imprudent of you to kill one of the bandits with a pistol.
They were instructed merely to disarm you. You were completely safe. But after
your rash killing it became much more difficult for me to try to rescue you.
And after the eclipse, it actually become impossible.&quot; Jadar wanted to ask
Hawksworth what had really happened, but he suppressed the impulse.
&quot;Still, after your first mistake, you appear to have handled yourself
reasonably well. That's why we're having this talk.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;In a dungeon? Surrounded by muskets?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;In a room surrounded by silver. More, I suspect, than
you have ever known. How many sailing ships, your 'frigates,' could be bought
with this much silver?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I don't know exactly. I do know English frigates are
not for sale.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Come, Captain. Would you have me believe your king
never has allies who share a common cause? That he never aids those who war
against his enemies?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Allies have been known to become enemies. If they grow
too ambitious. Just who would your frigates, assuming you had them and the
trained seamen to man them, be used against? The Portugals? Or against the
English eventually?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Sometimes, unfortunately, an ally becomes a tyrant,
forcing you to act in your own interest. I know it all too well.&quot; Jadar
was silent for a moment, then he smiled smoothly. &quot;But tell me about your
plans when you reach Agra. You'll have no frigates there. What do you hope to
gain?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Open trade. That and nothing more. England wants no war
with the Portugals.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Truly? I believe they may think otherwise. Time will
tell. There may be changes in Agra soon. The Christian Portuguese may find
their time has run out. If that happens, what will you do?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'll wait and see.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;There may be no time to 'wait,' English Captain
Hawksworth. The times may require you to choose. If the Portuguese decide to
act in the interest of one party here, will England act in the interest of the
other? I want to know.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The king of England acts in his own interest.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But your king will not be here. You will be here.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then I will act in his interest.&quot; Hawksworth fixed
Jadar squarely. &quot;And the king of England is not interested in who rules
India. Only in free trade between us.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But the one who rules India will have the power to
permit or deny that trade. You know, there's an Indian folk tale of a Brahmin
who once discovered a tiger in a well. He gave aid to the tiger, helped him
escape from the well, and years later when the Brahmin was starving the tiger
brought him a necklace of gold and jewels won from a rich man in a battle to
the death. Do you understand?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I understand. But I still serve my king first.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Jadar listened silently, but his eyes were intent.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And that king is English. For now.&quot; Jadar filled
the last words with a tone of presumption that left Hawksworth uncomfortable.
&quot;But enough. Let's talk of other matters. I assume you are aware the
Portuguese will probably try to have you assassinated when you reach Agra.
Already there are many rumors about you there. Perhaps you should remember your
own personal interests too. As well as your king's. One day, I think, we will
meet again. If you are still alive.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And if you are still alive.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Jadar smiled lightly. &quot;We're both difficult to kill. So
we both must think of the future. Now I have a last question for you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Jadar retrieved his knife from atop the bundles and deftly
ripped open the side of one. Rolls of new silver coin glistened in the light.
&quot;What do you see in this package, Ambassador Hawksworth?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;A king's ransom in silver.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm surprised at you, Captain. For a seaman you have
remarkably bad eyesight. What you see here, what came with you from Surat, is
lead, Captain. Ingots of lead.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That forty men died to protect.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Those men died protecting you, Captain. Don't you
remember? Your safety is very important to me. So important that it may be
necessary to keep you under guard here in the fortress until this campaign is
over. Look again at the bundle and tell me once more what you see.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You can't hold me here. I have a safe conduct pass from
the Moghul himself.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Do you? Good. In that case there shouldn't be any
difficulty. I'll only need to examine it to make sure it's not a forgery. There
should be an opportunity sometime after I return from this campaign.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth examined Jadar and realized the threat was not
empty.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;There's no reason for me to stay. You have your
lead.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Jadar smiled an empty grin, but with a trace of bizarre
warmth. &quot;At last we're beginning to understand each other. Neither of us
has a Rajput's honor.&quot; He tossed Hawksworth the Portuguese stiletto.
&quot;An interesting knife. Did you know it took me almost two weeks to find
out for sure who really hired the assassin? And for all that trouble it was
exactly who you'd expect.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth examined him in amazement, and decided to gamble
another guess.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I suppose I haven't thanked you yet for saving us from
the Portugals' ambush on the river, the day we made landfall.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Jadar waved his hand in dismissal. &quot;Mere curiosity,
nothing more. If I had allowed them to kill you, we could never have had this
interesting talk. But you still have many troubles ahead.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We both do.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But I know who my enemies are, Captain. That's the
difference.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The door had begun to swing slowly inward.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Yes, these are interesting times, Captain. You may find
it difficult to stay alive, but somehow I think you'll manage for a while
longer.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth watched nervously as the Rajput guards filed into
the room and stationed themselves by the door.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I plan to march south in ten days. You would be wise to
leave tomorrow for the north, while the roads are still secure. Vasant Rao has
asked to accompany you, and I'm afraid I have no choice but to humor him. I
need him here, but he is a man of temperament. I will provide guards for you as
far north as the Narbada River. After that he will hire his own horsemen. I'll
give him a letter for a raja in Mandu, who can supply whatever he needs.&quot;
Jadar studied Hawksworth one last time, his eyes calculating. &quot;We both
have difficult times ahead, but I think we'll meet again. Time may change a few
things for both of us.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As Hawksworth passed through the open doorway, he looked back
to see the prince leaning easily aginst a stack of bundles, flipping a large
silver coin. And suddenly he wanted to leave the fortress of Burhanpur more
than he had ever wanted anything in his life.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The next morning Vasant Rao and forty horsemen were waiting
with Hawksworth's cart. By midday they had left Burhanpur far behind, and were
well on the way north. The journey north through Mandu, Ujjain, and Gwalior to
Agra normally took six weeks, but when roads were dry it was an easy trip.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Two days later five prominent <i>mansabdars</i> in the
northern Deccan died painfully in separate ambushes by bandits. Their <i>jagirs</i>
were confiscated immediately by Prince Jadar. Ten days from that time he moved
south with eighty thousand men and thirty thousand horse.</span></p>

color:windowtext'>Nadir Sharif leaned uneasily against the rooftop railing of
his sprawling riverside palace, above the second-floor <i>zenana</i>, and
absently watched his Kabuli pigeons wing past the curve of the Jamuna River, headed
toward the Red Fort. They swept over the heavy battlements at the river gate
and then veered precisely upward, along the sheer eastern wall of the fort,
until they reached the gold minaret atop the Jasmine Tower, the private
quarters of Queen Janahara. They circled her tower once, then coalesced into a
plumed spear driving directly upward toward the dawn-tinged cloud bank that
hovered over Agra from the east.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Imported Kabuli pigeons, with their flawless white eyes and
blue-tipped wings, were Nadir Sharifs secret joy. Unlike the inferior local
breeds of the other devoted pigeon-fliers along the west bank of the Jamuna,
Agra's palace-lined showplace, his Kabulis did not flit aimlessly from rooftop
to rooftop on their daily morning flight. After he opened the shutters on their
rooftop grillwork cage, they would trace a single circle of his palace, next
wing past the Red Fort in a salute to the queen, then simply disappear into the
infinite for fully half a day, returning as regally as they had first taken wing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Nadir Sharif was the prime minister of the Moghul empire, the
brother of Queen Janahara, and the father of Prince Jadar's favorite wife,
Mumtaz. Even in the first light of dawn there was no mistaking he was Persian
and proud. The early sun glanced off his finely woven gauze cape and quickened
a warm glow in the gold thread laced through his yellow cloak and his pastel
morning turban. His quick eyes, plump face, and graying moustache testified to
his almost sixty years of life, thirty spent at the Moghul court as close
adviser to Arangbar and, before that, to Arangbar's father, the great
empire-builder Akman.  In power and authority he was exceeded only by the
Moghul himself.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Nadir Sharifs palace was deliberately situated next to the
Red Fort, just around the broad curve of the Jamuna. The Red Fort, home of the
Moghul, was a vast, rambling fortress whose river side towered over a hundred
feet above the western curve of the Jamuna. From Nadir Sharifs rooftop the view
of the river side of the fort and Arangbar's <i>darshan</i> window was
unobstructed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Darshan was the dawn appearance Arangbar made daily at a
special balcony in the east wall of the Red Fort, next to the river gate. It
was strict custom that the chief officials of Arangbar's court also appear
daily, on a high platform just beneath the <i>darshan</i> balcony, where along
with the Moghul they greeted the well-wishers who streamed in through the river
gate and provided visual confirmation that India's rule was intact.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The square below the balcony—a grassy expanse between the
side of the fort and the river wall, where Arangbar held noontime elephant
fights and, on Tuesdays, executions by specially trained elephants—had already
filled almost to capacity. Agra's most prominent noblemen were there, as
prudence required, and today there also were clusters of important visitors.
Several Rajput chieftains from the northwest, astride prancing Arabian horses,
passed regally through the river gate and assumed prominent positions. Then a
path was cleared for a large embassy of Safavid Persian diplomats, each of
whose palanquins was borne by four slaves in gleaming velvet liveries; next
several desert Uzbek khans in leather headdress rode into the square; and
finally three Portuguese Jesuits in black cassocks trooped through the river
gate and moved imperiously to the front of the crowd.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Nadir Sharif watched as his pigeons were swallowed by the
morning haze and then settled himself onto a canopied couch to observe <i>darshan</i>.
The eunuchs of the <i>zenana</i> had whispered that this morning would be
different, that there would be a precedent-shattering occurrence. For once a <i>zenana</i>
rumor seemed all too plausible, and late the previous evening he had sent a
dispatch through a <i>qazi</i>, a high judge, pleading illness and excusing
himself from <i>darshan</i>. And now he had stationed himself to watch. How
would the court officials react? Had they too heard the rumors? And what of
those who had gathered below to salute Arangbar with the traditional <i>teslim</i>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Most importantly, what of Nadir Sharif? This day could well
be a turning point in the course of India's history . . . and in the three
decades of his preeminence at court. If the rumors were true.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Nadir Sharif was easily the most accomplished courtier in
India, a skill that had earned him the most splendid palace in Agra after the
Moghul himself. His position brought with it not merely a palace, but also the <i>mansab</i>
rank and <i>jagir</i> wealth required to maintain it. Only enormous wealth
could sustain the hungry host of slaves, eunuchs, concubines, musicians, dancers,
and wives who thronged his Agra palace.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Success for Nadir Sharif had always seemed so effortless, so
inevitable, he often marveled that so few others had ever grasped the
elementary secret. His simple formula for longevity, in a court where favorites
daily rose and fell, was first to establish with certainty which side of a
difference would inevitably triumph, and then to unveil his own supporting
views.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He had made a lifelong habit of seeing everything. And saying
almost nothing. He understood well that thoughts unsaid often served better
than those voiced too hastly. Whereas the way of others might be flawed by a
penchant for the <i>zenana</i>, or jewels, or those intoxicants the Prophet ha
so futilely prohibited, Nadir Sharifs sole worldly obsession was power—from
which nothing, absolutely nothing, had ever turned his head. For a decade he
had ruled the Moghul empire in all but name, forwarding to Arangbar only those
petitions he favored, holding in advisement any he opposed, counseling the
Moghul at every turn—but always through other, unsuspecting voices if the
advice was anything save disguised flattery.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>His meticulous attention to affairs at court did not exclude
foreign trade. For years his voice had been raised against any who counseled
Arangbar in directions adverse to Portuguese interests. This attention did not
pass unnoticed in Goa, and when a kingly jewel was sent to Arangbar, another of
only slightly inferior dimensions always found its way into the hands of Nadir
Sharif.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The first rays of sun struck the hard ocher sandstone of the
Red Fort's east wall and suddenly it glowed like an inflamed ruby, throwing its
warmth across the face of the Jamuna River. Moments later the heightening sun
illuminated the rooftops of Agra, a sea of red tile and thatch that spread out
in a wide arc west of the fort.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Agra, the capital of Moghul India, was one of the great
cities of the East. It was home to over half a million, more than lived in any
capital of Europe, and some said a man on horseback could scarcely circle it in
a day. Yet most of the city was far from grand. It was a jumble of two-story
brick and tile merchant houses, clay-faced homes of Hindu tradesmen, and a
spreading sea of mud and thatch one-room hovels that sheltered the rest.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But along the river on either side of the Red Fort had been
created a different world. There glistened the mansions of Moghul grandees like
Nadir Sharif, magical and remote, behind whose walls lay spacious gardens
cooled by marble fountains and gilded rooms filled with carpets from Persia,
porcelains from China, imported crystal from Venice. Their <i>zenanas</i>
thronging with exquisite, dark-eyed women, and their tapestried halls with
hosts of slaves and eunuchs.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Nadir Sharif inhaled the clean air of morning and surveyed
the palaces on either side along the riverbank. They were all sumptuous, but
none more than his own. A vainer man might have swelled with pride at such a
moment, but Nadir Sharif knew from years of court experience that vanity always
led, inevitably, to excess, and finally to debt and ruin. To keep one's place,
he often told himself, one must know it. He also knew that to hold one's
ground, one must know when to shift.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>His reverie was abruptly dispelled by the noise of shuffling
feet, and then a hesitant voice.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;A man is at the outer gate, Sharif Sahib, asking to see
you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Nadir Sharif turned to see the eunuch's spotless white turban
bowing toward him. He flared inwardly that his orders for absolute privacy had
been ignored, and then, as always, he waited a few seconds for composure before
speaking.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm too ill to receive. Have you already forgotten my
orders?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Forgive me, Sharif Sahib.&quot; The eunuch bowed ever
lower and raised his clasped palms in involuntary supplication. &quot;He has
demanded an audience. He claimed he has arrived last night from the Deccan. He
was with the prince . . .&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Nadir Sharifs body tensed perceptibly. &quot;What name did he
give?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;A Rajput name, Sharif Sahib. He said he was requested
by Her Highness, the princess, to report to you immediately on arriving.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Nadir Sharifs heart skipped a beat. Does this mean the
English <i>feringhi</i> has arrived? Allah! On this of all days.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Tell him I am at home.&quot; The voice was coolly
matter-of-fact.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The eunuch bowed again and disappeared without a word. As
Nadir Sharif watched his skirt vanish past the doorway tapestry, he tried to
clear his mind and decide quickly what now must be done. Instinctively he
turned once more to monitor the <i>darshan</i> balcony. Still nothing. Then he
smiled fleetingly, realizing that the fate of the Englishman would depend very
much on what happened at <i>darshan</i> this very morning.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The visitor appeared, in freshly brushed red turban and
jeweled earrings, and wordlessly strode past the eunuch at the doorway, pushing
the partially opened tapestry aside as though a foe in battle. There was about
the man the haughty carriage and contemptuous eyes always encountered among
Rajputs in high places, and Nadir Sharif recognized him immediately. The prime
minister also knew this particular Rajput had never trusted him, and never
would.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Nimaste, Sharif Sahib.&quot; Vasant Rao's salaam was
correct but cold. &quot;It's always a pleasure to see you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;When did you arrive?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Last evening.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Have you arranged lodgings for the English <i>feringhi</i>? 
Even before informing me you were here?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;He has no lodgings yet, Sharif Sahib, only rooms at a
guest house. The <i>feringhi</i> insisted no one be informed of his arrival. He
did not say why.&quot; Vasant Rao returned Nadir Sharifs expressionless stare.
&quot;The prince's orders were to honor the <i>feringhi’s</i> requests whenever
possible.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Nadir Sharifs face betrayed none of his anger as he turned
again toward the <i>darshan</i> balcony. A flock of vagrant pigeons darted
overhead, following the line of palaces along the river.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;How is the child?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;He is well formed, Sharif Sahib. Your daughter, Her
Highness, was also well when I left Burhanpur. She gave me this dispatch for
you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Nadir Sharif accepted the bamboo tube and, controlling his
expression, tossed it aside as though it were of no more consequence than a
gardener's report brought by a eunuch. &quot;I've received no pigeons from her
for four weeks. Only official dispatches from Ghulam Adl's secretary in
Burhanpur, which tell nothing. Why isn't he in the field with Jadar? What is
happening?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm not with the army now, Sharif Sahib.&quot; Vasant
Rao casually stroked his moustache. &quot;Perhaps the prince has ordered
secrecy to protect his movements toward the south.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Nadir Sharif started to reply, but immediately thought better
of it. Instead he traced his finger along the railing of the balcony in silence
and seemed to listen to the distant pigeons as he rotated the answer in his
mind, knowing it was a lie and quickly evaluating the possible reasons why.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>In the north, dispatching pigeons in the field might be a
risk, but never in the south, where the infidel Deccanis always know the
deployment of our army better than its own commanders. No. There's something
planned that Jadar does not want me to know. Which can only mean His impulsive
Highness, Prince Jadar has undertaken something foolish. I know him too well.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>After a moment Nadir Sharif broke the silence, without
turning his face from the <i>darshan</i> balcony.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Tell me about the <i>feringhi</i>.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Do you mean what he says? Or what I think about
him?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Both.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;He claims to be an ambassador for the English king, but
his only credentials are a letter he brings, said to request a trading <i>firman</i>
from His Majesty.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What are the intentions of this <i>feringhi</i> king?
Trade, or eventual meddling?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;No one has seen the letter, Sharif Sahib, but the
Englishman says his king merely asks to trade yearly at Surat.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Which means the English must again contest with the
Portuguese. Until one of them eventually abandons our ports. They cannot both
trade. The Portuguese Viceroy would never allow it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What you say seems true. It's said the Christians in
Europe are having a holy war. I don't understand the cause, but the English and
the Portuguese seem to be historic enemies because of it. However, the
Englishman claims their disputes in Europe are now over, and that the
Portuguese attack on his ships was in violation of a treaty of peace recently
signed. Whether this is actually true no one knows. The English ships are gone
now, but if they come again, who can say what will happen.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Will they come again?&quot; Nadir Sharifs eyes told
nothing of his thoughts, but his voice sharpened. &quot;Soon?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The Englishman has not said. Perhaps next year. Perhaps
before that.&quot; Vasant Rao caught the inflection in Nadir Sharif’s voice,
and it triggered a chain of improbable possibilities.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Goa will never allow them open access to Surat. There
must be war on our seas if the English return.&quot; Nadir Sharif paused for a
moment and then continued. &quot;Who do you think will triumph?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Ask those who claim the gift of prophecy, Sharif Sahib.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>I'm only a
soldier.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>      
&quot;That's why I asked you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I can only say that if other English are like this man,
then they are a determined race. He seems to seek the new because it is there,
yet perhaps not knowing what he will do with it once it is his.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What do you mean?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The Englishman, Hawksworth. He claims to be here for
his king and his king only. But I sense this is only partly true. He is a man
of complex desires.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then why is he here?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I think he is here also for himself. He wants
something.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Perhaps it's to make war on the Portuguese?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;He will not shrink from it. But I think his own coming
to India is to find something. He is searching, for what I cannot say. He is a
man of curious parts. He spoke once of spending time in prison. And he is
devoted to playing a small stringed instrument. He understands the tongue of
the Moghuls, and he questions all he sees. He is beginning to know India,
because he has made it his purpose to know India. If he stays, he could become
very troubling for the Portuguese.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And will that bring no good to affairs here?&quot;
Nadir Sharif paused. &quot;Will it?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I do not follow matters of state, Sharif Sahib.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Nadir Sharif let the silence swell, then in a voice brittle
as ice he spoke.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Why did the prince meet with him?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Vasant Rao tried without success to mask his surprise. Lord
Krishna, they know everything in Agra.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;There was a meeting.&quot; Vasant Rao hesitated, then
decided to maintain discretion. &quot;But neither spoke of it afterwards.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Nadir Sharif studied him, pondering if it were true. Then he
turned to glance at the <i>darshan</i> balcony as he spoke.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The Moghul has demanded that the English <i>feringhi</i>
be brought to <i>durbar</i> immediately after he arrives.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Does that mean today?&quot; Vasant Rao shifted with
surprise.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;His Majesty will hear soon enough he has arrived. There
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>is no
choice.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then the <i>feringhi</i> must be told to prepare,
Sharif Sahib. He has a chest containing gifts, and the letter.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I know what he has. Tell him he must bring the gifts to
<i>durbar</i>. For his sake I hope they're not trifles. His Majesty is most
anxious to see them.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>And the queen is even more anxious to see the letter, Nadir
Sharif told himself. Then he smiled as he realized he would see it first.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It will be an interesting afternoon.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>A fanfare of drums sounded faintly from the ramparts of the
Red Fort, and for a moment the morning sun seemed to glow even brighter against
the gleaming panels of the Jasmine Tower. Nadir Sharif turned toward the <i>darshan</i>
balcony. From the shadow of its embroidered satin awning a figure had suddenly
emerged. It was just possible to make out the man's glistening robe and his
elaborate, patterned turban. Then the heavy jewels of his earrings momentarily
caught the morning sunshine and sent streams of light flashing outward. All the
waiting crowd bowed low, each man touching the back of his right hand to the
ground and then bringing the palm to his forehead as he drew erect. It was the
formal <i>teslim</i> given the Moghul, signifying each man's readiness to give
himself as an offering.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Nadir Sharif scrutinized the scene carefully and drew an
almost audible sigh of relief. Then he turned to Vasant Rao.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Have you ever seen the Moghul at morning <i>darshan</i>?
He continued on distractedly, neglecting to pause for an answer. &quot;You
know, it's actually a custom began by Akman, who worshiped the sun as one of
the gods. But Arangbar appears in order to maintain his own authority. If he
missed <i>darshan</i> for a day, rumors would begin he was dead. Three days and
there would be anarchy.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Suddenly the cheers from the courtyard died abruptly. In the
silence that followed, a single pigeon's cry could be heard from overhead.
Nadir Sharif whirled to see a second figure now standing on the balcony beside
Arangbar.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It was a dark-haired woman. He could not tell if she wore a
veil, but her tiara of jewels glistened in the early sun. The color drained
from Nadir Sharif’s face as he watched.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>So the rumor was true. For the first time in history, she has
appeared beside him at <i>darshan</i>, to be worshiped equally.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Vasant Rao found himself staring in astonishment.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Queen Janahara. This is truly the beginning of the end for
the prince. He will never see Agra again. Unless he's at the head of an army,
or in chains.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What does it mean?&quot; Vasant Rao could think of
nothing else to say.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Times and fashions change. Perhaps it's a whim of His
Majesty.&quot; Nadir Sharif did not turn his gaze from the balcony. He did not
want Vasant Rao to see his eyes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Escort the <i>feringhi</i> to <i>durbar</i> today. He's
not safe here alone.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;As you wish, Sharif Sahib.&quot; Vasant Rao paused and
studied the back of Nadir Sharifs turban. &quot;Do you have a message for the
prince when I return?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Official channels will serve for any message I have to
give the prince.&quot; The prime minister whirled with uncharacteristic
abruptness. &quot;That will be all. You would be wise to be out of Agra when
the sun rises tomorrow.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As Vasant Rao made his way past the waiting eunuchs, Nadir
Sharif turned once more to examine the <i>darshan</i> balcony. He watched in
growing dismay as the courtiers on the platform began salaams to Queen Janahara,
who now stood boldly at the forefront of the canopied marble portico.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then he recalled the dispatch from Mumtaz.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>A line of mounted Imperial guards cleared a pathway through
the narrow street, now a midday throng of bullock carts, dark-skinned porters,
ambling cattle, and black-veiled women balancing heavy brass pots atop their
heads. Along both sides of the street tan awnings shielded lines of quick-
eyed, bearded merchants, who squatted on their porches beckoning all to inspect
their unprecedented bargains in cloth, reeds, betel leaves. Vendors sizzled
flat bread in charcoal-fired round pans and dropped balls of brown dough into
dark pots of smoking oil, seasoning the dusty air with piquant spice. Above the
clatter of their horses' hooves came a cacophony of street Hindi, squeaking
cart wheels, children's discordant piping.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Between the open shops were ornate doorways, framed in
delicate plasterwork scallops, leading upward to overhead balconies supported
by red sandstone brackets. Behind the latticework screens that fronted these
balconies—some carved rosewood, some filigreed marble—Hawksworth could see
clusters of idle women chewing betel and fanning themselves as they leaned
forward to inspect the procession below.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth studied the helmeted guards around him, whose
ornate shields bore the Moghurs personal seal, and reflected on his
introduction to Agra. His caravan from the south had arrived at the city's
outskirts the evening before, after the sun's light had died away, and as he
requested, Vasant Rao had found a traditional guest house for them. It was near
the center of town, inconspicuous, and its primary amenities were a rainproof
thatch roof and a stone floor. Tomorrow, the Rajput had told him, he must find
a house befitting an ambassador.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The guards accompanying them into Agra had not even
dismounted, had turned back immediately for the south, and only Vasant Rao
stayed to share the evening meal. They had dined quickly on fried bread and
lentils and afterward the Rajput had retrieved his saddle from the stable and,
pillowing it under his helmet, immediately fallen asleep, curved sword in hand.
Hawksworth had lain awake listening to the night sounds of Agra, wondering what
his next move should be. Sleep finally overtook him just before dawn broke.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He awoke to discover Vasant Rao already gone. But the Rajput
had mysteriously returned in time to share a breakfast of more fried bread and
spiced curds. After eating, Vasant Rao had announced that Arangbar expected him
in <i>durbar</i> that afternoon. The rest of the morning had been spent hastily
procuring bearers for his chest of gifts and cleaning the mildewed doublet and
hose he had been instructed by the Company to wear. Just after noon, a
contingent of the Moghul’s personal guard had arrived</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>unexpectedly
with orders to escort them through the center of Agra, directly to the Moghul’s
private entrance to the Red Fort.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Their horses emerged abruptly from the narrow, jostling
street and Hawksworth realized they had entered a wide, sunlit plaza opening
outward from the fort's south gate. The close, acrid smells of the town were
immediately scourged by the searing midday heat. Hawksworth reined in his horse
and stared at the fort, incredulous at its immensity.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>They were facing two concentric walls of polished red
sandstone, the outer easily forty feet high and the inner at least seventy.
Both were obviously thick, with battlements loop-holed for musketry and crowned
by rampart-ways. A wide wooden drawbridge leading to the entrance spanned a
thirty-foot, water-filled moat that followed the outer wall in both directions
as far as the eye could see.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It had to be the largest, most powerfully built fortress
Hawksworth had ever seen. No story he had heard, no imagined grandeur, had
prepared him for this first view. The sight was at once awesome and chilling.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>No wonder the Moghul frightens all of India. It's
impregnable. The outer blocks of the walls seem to be linked by massive iron
rings and the round towers spaced along them have slots designed for heavy
ordnance. With two thick walls, which probably also have a moat between, it
would be impossible to storm. And cannon would be almost useless.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Vasant Rao monitored Hawksworth's reaction, and his dark eyes
betrayed his pride. &quot;Do you understand now why the Moghul is held in such
regard? No king in the world could have a palace as grand as this. Did you know
that the distance around the walls is over one <i>kos</i>. What would that be?
Around two of your English miles?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth nodded assent as their guards led them directly across
the wide drawbridge and through a passageway. The outer edge of the drawbridge
was connected by heavy chains to rollers at the top of the entryway. The two
rollers worked in a stone channel cut upward into the steep walls of the
passage and were held in place by iron bars inserted into the channel. The
bridge would lift automatically by simple removal of the iron bars. Around them
now was a small, heavily defended barbican and ahead, between the outer and
inner wall, was a gateway set in a towering portal almost eighty feet high that
was faced with gleaming blue enamel tiles.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;How many gates like this are there?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The Red Fort actually has four gates, one on the river
and one on each of the other sides. This is the southern gate, which the Moghul
recently renamed the Amar Singh Gate&quot;—Vasant Rao lowered his
voice—&quot;after a defiant Rajput who he murdered. I have never seen it
before, but it is even more beautiful than the public Delhi Gate, on the north,
which is inlaid marble. The Red Fort is truly astonishing. Tell me, Captain, is
there anything in your England to compare?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Nothing.&quot; Hawksworth seached for his voice.
&quot;Why is it so large?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;This is the place where India is governed. And the
Moghul does not live alone. He has to house over a thousand women, an army to
protect him and his treasury, and more servants than man can count.&quot; The
Rajput seemed momentarily puzzled by the question. Then he continued with a sly
smile. &quot;The fort was built by the Moghul’s father, the great Akman. People
say it required over eight years to complete. He also built another complete
city in the desert a few <i>kos</i> west of here, but later he abandoned it and
moved back to Agra. Surely your English king governs from a palace.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;His Majesty, King James, has a palace at Hampton Court.&quot;
Hawksworth paused. &quot;But England is governed by laws made in Parliament,
which has its own place to meet.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It sounds like you have a very weak king. Captain
Hawksworth, if he cannot rule.&quot; Vasant Rao glanced nervously at the
guards. &quot;You would do well not to tell that to Arangbar. In India there is
only one law, the word of the Moghul.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As they entered the portico of the Amar Singh Gate,
Hawksworth glanced behind him, relieved to see that their porters still
followed, one at each side of his sea chest. Vasant Rao had cautioned him not
to deliver all the gifts at once, since Arangbar would expect a new gift each
time they met. King James's letter he carried personally, carefully secreted
inside his doublet.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Inside the archway of the gate were sets of thick wooden
doors, opened back against the sides. These inner doors bristled with long iron
spikes, and as Hawksworth puzzled over them, Vasant Rao caught his questioning
look.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Those spikes embedded in the doors are to prevent war
elephants from battering them in with their foreheads. It's common in a
fortress.&quot; He smiled. &quot;But then I keep forgetting your England
probably has no elephants.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Ahead, at the terminus of the archway, the path was blocked
by a heavy chain and armed sentries. The guards reined in their horses and
began to dismount, while their leader passed brusque orders to Vasant Rao.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We ride no farther,&quot; Vasant Rao translated as he
swung from the saddle. &quot;He says no one except the Moghul himself, his
sons, or his women is allowed to ride through the Amar Singh Gate. It's
strictly enforced.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth paused one last time, feeling about him the weight
of the thick walls and the ornate tower rising above them, a great blue jewel
in the afternoon sun. For a moment he had the curious sensation of entering a
giant tomb. He took a deep breath and slowly dismounted, feeling suddenly
conspicuous in his formal silk hose and ruffled doubtlet.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Vasant Rao passed the reins of his horse to a waiting servant
and drew alongside, his eyes intent. &quot;Does it seem strange to you that the
Moghul would name one of the four gates to the Red Fort after a Rajput?&quot;
He stroked the curl of his moustache, and lowered his voice. &quot;It's a story
you should hear. It's not meant as an honor.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What do you mean?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It's intended to be a warning to all Rajputs of what
happens when he is defied. There was, several years ago, a Rajput adventurer
named Amar Singh. He sought to rise to position in Arangbar's court—he
eventually did rise to the rank of a thousand horse—and along the way he asked
and received the help of an old courtier who had influence. Only later did the
Rajput find out that this man expected his younger daughter in payment.&quot;
Vasant Rao smile wryly. &quot;They say she was incredibly beautiful. Well, Amar
Singh was a true Rajput, and he was outraged. Naturally he refused. So the
courtier who had helped him decided to have revenge, and he went to Arangbar
and told him about a certain beautiful Rajput girl who would make an excellent
addition to the <i>zenana</i>. The Moghul immediately sent some of his personal
guards to Amar Singh's house to take the girl. When Amar Singh realized why the
guards had come, he called for the girl and stabbed her to death before their
eyes. Then he took horse and rode to the Red Fort, even riding through this
gate. He rode into the audience hall and demanded that Arangbar appear and
explain. Such things, Captain, are simply not done in Agra. The moment he
dismounted he was cut to pieces by a dozen of Arangbar's guards. Then the
Moghul decided to name this gate after him, to remind all Rajputs of his fate.
But he need not have bothered. No Rajput will ever forget.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Leaving the servants with their horses, they proceeded on
foot up a wide, inclined path that led through an enclosed square. Around the
sides of the square were porticoes and galleries, where horsemen with swords
and pikes waited.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Those men are on their <i>chauki</i>, their seventh-day
watch.&quot; Vasant Rao pointed to the porticoes. &quot;Every soldier in Agra
must stand watch once every seven days. Either here or in the large square
inside, where we're going. It's the Moghul’s law.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>They passed through another large gate and suddenly a half
dozen turbaned guards, in leather armor and wearing long curved swords, drew
alongside, as though expecting them. Now with a double escort they began the
ascent of a long walkway, perhaps twenty paces wide, situated between two high
brick walls. Hawksworth's leather shoes padded against the square paving
stones, which had been striated to permit easy footing for the Moghurs horses
and elephants. As they reached the end, they emerged into another large court,
comprising the southeast corner of the fort.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Ahead was yet a fourth gate. As they passed through,
Hawksworth realized it was protected by more mounted</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>horsemen in
the recessed lower porticoes, and archers in elevated galleries. They walked
past the wide wooden doors and into a vast milling square. It was several
hundred feet on the side and ringed with arcades where still more mounted
horsemen waited. A wide roadway divided the square.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;This is the quadrangle. I only saw it once before, but
then I entered from the public side.&quot; Vasant Rao indicated an identical
gate, directly opposite. &quot;Over there.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The guards directed them toward a large multicolored silk
canopy fanning out from the tall buildings on their right. The area beneath the
canopy was cordoned off from the square by a red velvet railing, and porters
with cudgels stood around the perimeter. Vasant Rao seemed increasingly nervous
as their escorts led them forward, past the guards at the entry to the canopy.
Hawksworth noticed that the air beneath the canopy was heavy with
incense—ambergris and aloe—burning in gold and silver censers hanging from
poles.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The arcade ahead is the <i>Diwan-i-Am</i>, the Hall of
Public Audience, where the Moghul holds his daily <i>durbar</i>.&quot; Vasant
Rao pointed toward the steps that led upward to a large open pavilion at the
far end of the canopy. It was several stories high and over a hundred feet on
each side. The roof was borne by marble arches supported by rows of white
columns. &quot;No man with rank under five hundred horse is allowed to enter
inside the railing. I think that's why we have a special escort.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Above the crowd, at the far end of the hall, was a raised
platform of white marble, standing about three feet from the floor and covered
by its own tapestried canopy. The platform was surrounded by a silver railing,
and several turbaned men holding rolls of documents were now struggling to gain
a position at the rail. All around them the crowd buzzed with anticipation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Behind and above the platform, in a marble gallery set in the
wall, rested an immense throne carved from black marble. At its four corners
were life-sized statues of rearing lions, each spangled with jewels, which
supported in their silver paws a canopy of pure gold. The walls on either side
of the throne were latticework marble screens, through which the <i>zenana</i>
women could watch.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I've never seen the throne this close before. It's
famous.&quot; Vasant Rao paused. &quot;And there are some in Agra who would
sell their brother to have it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The Imperial guards suddenly saluted, fists against their
leather shields, turned and marched down the steps of the <i>Diwan-i-Am</i> and
back into the square. Vasant Rao watched them disappear into the crowd and then
he shook the left sleeve of his riding cloak and a naked <i>katar</i>, the
deadly &quot;tiger knife&quot; all Rajputs carried, dropped into his hand. Its
handle was a gold-plated grip between two prongs, designed to be held in the
fist and thrust directly forward. Without a word he slipped it into a sheath
secured in the sash of his belt.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth pretended not to notice and instead turned to
examine the crowd. Next to them an assembly of Persian diplomats, wearing heavy
robes and jewel-encrusted turbans, eyed Hawksworth's plain doublet and hose
with open contempt. The air was thick was sweat and incense and the sparkle of
gold and jewels.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Uniformed servants sounded a drum roll on two large brass
kettles at the back of the throne and the velvet curtains behind the throne
parted. Two guards with gold-handled swords entered briskly and stood at
attention, one on either side of the parted curtains.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth felt his pulse surge as the next figure entered
through the curtains.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He was of middle height, with a small moustache and glistening
diamond earrings. He wore a tight patterned turban, a blue robe secured by a
gold brocade sash, jeweled rings on both hands, and a massive string of pearls.
A golden-handled sword and dagger were at his waist, and two feline cubs
frisked by his side. Hawksworth studied them in confusion, and after a moment
realized they must be baby lions, an animal famous in English folklore but
never actually seen firsthand by anyone in England.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>At that instant a din of kettledrums erupted from galleries
at the sides of the square. Almost as one those waiting called out a salaam,
bent forward, and touched the back of their right hand to the ground and then
to their forehead as they drew erect. The <i>durbar</i> of the Moghul had
begun.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You did not perform the <i>teslim</i>.&quot; Vasant Rao
turned to Hawksworth with dismay in his voice. &quot;He may have taken note of
it. That was unwise, my friend.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;An ambassador for a king doesn't prostrate
himself.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You're new to India. That may be taken as an excuse.
The other ambassadors here know better.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As they watched, three other men slowly emerged from behind
the throne and took thei</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>r
 place</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>s on the marble
platform, standing beside the Moghul. They all wore jeweled turbans and each
had a sash of gold cloth about the waist. Hawksworth turned to Vasant Rao in
time to see a look of hatred flash through his eyes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Who are they?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The two younger men are his sons. I saw them once
before in Agra. It's traditional that his sons join him at the <i>durbar</i>
when they are here. The younger one is Allaudin. He will be married next month
to Queen Janahara's daughter. The other one is his drunken brother Parwaz. The
older man is Zainul Beg, the Moghurs <i>wazir</i>, his chief counsel. He's the
father of Nadir Sharif, the prime minister, and he's also the father of Queen Janahara.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth watched as yet another man emerged through the
curtain, walked casually past the throne, and was helped onto the marble
platform directly in front. He turned to the silver rail, where a dozen
petitions were immediately thrust up to him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Vasant Rao nudged Hawksworth and pointed. &quot;And that's
Nadir Sharif, the prime minister. Remember him well. No one reaches the Moghul
without his consent.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The prime minister paused to study the faces below, and then
reached out for a petition. He unrolled it, scanned it quickly, and turned to
Arangbar, passing it upward with a comment only those by the throne could hear.
The business of the day was underway.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Arangbar listened with obvious boredom as one petition after
another was set before him. He held counsel with his sons and with the <i>wazir</i>,
and frequently he would turn to the marble screen off the right side of the
throne and discuss a petition with someone waiting behind it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Below the platform several ambassadors shuffled, trying to
mask their impatience. Hawksworth suddenly realized that the jewel-encrusted
boxes they held, many of beaten gold, contained presents for the Moghul. He
looked at his own leatherbound wooden chest, shabby by comparison, and his
heart began to sink.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>After a short while, the Moghul seemed to lose patience with
the petitions and, ignoring the waiting nobles, abruptly signaled for a review
of the day's elephant troops. Moments later, a line of war elephants entered
through the public gate and began to march single-file across the back of the
square. Their tusks were wreathed with gold bands and they wore coverings of
embroidered cloth which were strung with tinkling bells and tassels of Tibetan
yak hair. As each reached a spot directly in front of the <i>Diwan-i-Am</i> it
stopped, kneeled, and trumpeted to Arangbar.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>When the last elephant had passed, drums were sounded again
and a group of eight men came into the square leading a snarling beast by heavy
chains attached to its iron collar. It was tawny, with a heavy mane and
powerful paws, and it roared out its displeasure as it writhed and clawed at
the chains.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth took one look and realized it was a fully-grown
male lion.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That seems to be His Majesty's new toy.&quot; Vasant
Rao pointed nervously. &quot;He collects lions as pets. That one must have just
been captured.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Arangbar studied the lion with obvious delight. Then he bent
down and stroked one of the cubs by his side, lifting it to better view the new
prize. The assembly watched spellbound for a moment, then burst into cheers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As Hawksworth watched, Arangbar set down the lion cub and
spoke with his <i>wazir</i>. Zainul Beg stared into the crowd and then pointed.
Moments later the black cassock of a Jesuit appeared at the railing. With a
start Hawksworth recognized Father Alvarez Sarmento, last seen in the courtyard
of Mukarrab Khan's palace in Surat. The Jesuit listened to the <i>wazir's</i>
instructions and then turned to the crowd. His announcement was in English.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;His Majesty orders the ambassador from England to come
forward.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Vasant Rao touched Hawksworth's arm and reached out to clasp
his hand.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;This is your moment, my friend. By the time <i>durbar</i>
is through I will be far from here.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Why are you leaving?&quot; Hawksworth turned and looked
into his eyes, suddenly realizing that Vasant Rao was the closest thing he had
to a friend in India.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It's impossible for me to stay longer.&quot; Vasant Rao
paused, and Hawksworth sensed his warmth was genuine. Suddenly the Rajput
reached into the sash at his belt and drew out his sheathed <i>katar</i>.
&quot;You saved my life once, in the village, and I've never found the words to
thank you. Perhaps this can say it for me. Take it as a token of friendship
from a Rajput. It was given to me by my father, and it has tasted blood more
times than I can count. You're a brave and honest man, and I think we'll meet
again.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Before Hawksworth could speak, Vasant Rao embraced him warmly
and melted into the crowd.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>A pathway was clearing through the glaring nobles, and
Hawksworth quickly slipped the katar into his doublet as he leaned over to secure
the chest. When he reached the silver railing, Sarmento was waiting.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Let me welcome you to Agra, Captain.&quot; The Jesuit
spoke quietly in English, his face a hard mask. &quot;I pray God gave you a
pleasant journey.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I thought you were bound for Lahore.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;In time, Captain, in time. But we have an Agra mission
as well. Our flock here grows. It must be tended. And do you remember what we
agreed that night in Surat?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Translate for the Inglish ambassador.&quot; Arangbar's
voice interrupted, speaking in Persian. &quot;I would know his name.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;He asks your name.&quot; Sarmento spoke quietly to
Hawksworth in English. &quot;You must bow when you give it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I am Captain-General Brian Hawksworth, ambassador of
His Majesty, King James the First of England.&quot; Hawksworth replied in
Turkish, trying to remember the speech he had been told to deliver. A look of
delighted surprise flashed through Arangbar's eyes. Hawksworth bowed and then
continued. &quot;His Majesty, King James, has asked me to convey his friendship
to His Most Noble Majesty, Arangbar, Moghul of India, together with certain
unworthy tokens of his regard.&quot; Hawksworth tried to think quickly of a way
to explain the unimpressive gifts King James had sent. &quot;Those trifles he
sends are not intended as gifts deserving of Your Majesty, for that would be a
bounty no single man could deliver. Instead he has asked me to bring certain
common products of our country, not as gifts, for they are too unworthy, but as
samples of English workmanship that Your Majesty may examine personally the
goods he offers your merchants in trade. These are the first of many,
more-worthy gifts he is now assembling for Your Majesty, to be sent on future
voyages to your land.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You speak the tongue of the Moghuls, Ambassador.
Already your king does me honor. I welcome you in his name.&quot; Arangbar
leaned forward to watch as Hawksworth opened the clasp on the chest.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The first items were samples of English woolens, lace, and
brocade, crafted into doublets. Hawksworth laid these aside and took out a
silver-trimmed brace of pistols, a gold- handled sword, an hourglass in carved
ivory, and finally a gold whistle studded with small diamonds. The Moghul
peered down from his marble throne impassively, and then called for them to be
brought to him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>While he examined each gift briefly, assessing it with a
quick glance and calling for the next, Hawksworth reached into the corner of
the box and withdrew the next present, a three-cornered English hat topped with
a feather. When Arangbar saw the hat his eyes brightened.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;At last I can look like a <i>topiwallah</i>.&quot; He
pushed aside the other gifts and called for the hat. He turned it in his hand
for a moment, then removed his jeweled turban and clapped it on his head with
delight.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The <i>feringhi</i> hat is a puzzling invention,
Ambassador Khawksworth.&quot; Arangbar stumbled over the pronunciation of the
name as he signaled for a mirror. &quot;What purpose it serves I have never
understood. You, I observe, do not wear one yourself.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Hats are not to my taste, may it please Your
Majesty.&quot; Hawksworth bowed again and then continued. &quot;His Majesty,
King James of England, also has asked me to deliver a portrait of himself to
Your Majesty, together with letter expressing his desire for friendship between
your land and his.&quot; Hawksworth produced a small framed watercolor from the
wooden chest. It was a miniature on vellum, scarcely more than an inch square,
by Isaac Oliver, a celebrated artist from the school of Nicholas Hilliard, who
had been fashionable under Queen Elizabeth. While Arangbar examined the
painting, scrutinizing the workmanship as might a connoisseur, Hawksworth
reached into his doublet and withdrew the letter. It was passed to Nadir
Sharif, who presented it to Arangbar.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The Moghul reluctantly handed the portrait to Allaudin, then
inspected the leather binding of the letter. Finally he broke the red wax seal
and began to study the writing, a quizzical expression spreading over his face.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The seal and script are worthy of a king. But it is in
a language of Europe.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;There are two copies, Your Majesty. One in English, the
language of my king, and one in Spanish, a language something like the
Portugals speak.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then we will have Father Sarmento translate.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Sarmento moved to the silver railing and took the
leatherbound letter with a distasteful expression. He examined it for a moment
and then began to read it silently, the color slowly draining from his face.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What message does your king send, Ambassador?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;His admiration for Your Majesty, whose reputation has
reached even Europe. And his offer of full and open trade between your nation
and his.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The letter is basely penned, Your Majesty.&quot;
Sarmento's face was red with dismay as he turned to Arangbar. &quot;Its style
is unworthy of a great prince.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Arangbar examined the Jesuit with a troubled gaze and shifted
on his throne.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;May it please Your Majesty, this man is the enemy of
England.&quot; Hawksworth pointed at Sarmento. &quot;How can my king's letter
be ill-penned, when he entreats Your Majesty's friendship?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Arangbar paused a moment and then he smiled broadly. &quot;A
reasonable reply. The Inglish, I see, are a blunt-spoken race.&quot; He glanced
at Sarmento. &quot;And we have already seen their seamanship.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Your words honor my king, Your Majesty.&quot;
Hawksworth found himself bowing again and wondering how to respond.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We would hear more of England. Is it large?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Not nearly as large as India, Your Majesty. It is an
island, but the queen of all the islands of the West.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It is a rocky, barren speck in the great seas of
Europe, Your Majesty,&quot; Sarmento interjected himself, straining to hold his
composure. &quot;A breeder of drunken fishermen and pirates. Its king is a
heretic, a sovereign of lawless privateers and an enemy of the Holy
Church.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It is a noble land, Your Majesty, ruled by a free king,
not by a Spanish tyrant or an Italian pope, like the land of the Portugals. Our
cannon are the best in the world, our ships the swiftest, our men the bravest.
No flag but our own has ever flown above our soil. Our ships have sailed all
the seas of the world, from the East to the West. My king's seamen have explored
the seas north of England, searching for a northeast passage to the Indies, and
the Americas, searching for a northwest passage. Off your own shores we have
met the galleons of Portugal, as Your Majesty must know, and in the West Indies
we have challenged and overcome the carracks of Papist Spain. There brave
English captains named Hawkins and Drake stood off Spaniards ten times their
number. The very name of England strikes fear in the heart of a Portugal or a
Spaniard.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Arangbar toyed with the jeweled whistle as he listened.
&quot;Your England interests us, Ambassador Khawksworth.&quot; He paused for a
moment and reviewed the small, dispiriting assemblage of gifts. &quot;We would
know when your king's next voyage will be.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Very soon, may it please Your Majesty.&quot; Hawksworth
squirmed, and noticed Nadir Sharif suddenly edge closer to listen.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But your king must send out voyages regularly? We have
heard of the English traders in our southern seas. Do you not know when the
next voyage will be, or what gifts your king is preparing? Surely he will send
them this year?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;May it please Your Majesty&quot;—Hawksworth fumbled
with the railing, trying to gain time—&quot;I . . .&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Prince Parwaz suddenly plucked at Arangbar's arm and pointed
into the crowd. A tall bearded man with a vast turban and two ornate swords at
his side had moved next to the silver railing, near Hawksworth, holding a
petition in his hand.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;He is the man I spoke of yesterday.&quot; Parwaz spoke
in Turki, and his words seemed slurred. Hawksworth realized he was tipsy.
&quot;I told him to bring his petition today personally. He's a commander with
the rank of a thousand horse. His stipend is eight thousand rupees a month. He
claims he has served honorably, most recently in the siege of Qandahar, but
that he must resign his <i>mansab</i> and dismiss his men and horse unless his
stipend is increased.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Arangbar examined the man for a moment, then addressed him in
Turki.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What is your name and rank?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I am Amanat Mubarik, Your Majesty. I maintain a
thousand horse, the finest Arabian blood in India.&quot; The man stood straight
and spoke with a loud, clear voice.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Is not your stipend the amount prescribed any man who
maintains that number?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It is, Your Highness. But I am not any man. I am a
Pathan, and my father was Fath Shah. No enemy of Your Majesty has ever seen the
back of my shield. His Highness, Prince Parwaz, saw me defend the royal
encampment five years ago when he moved south of the Narbada. With my cavalry I
held position when all others called for retreat. I challenge any man here
today to do me battle in your presence. With any weapon. On horseback or on
foot. Then you may decide if I am as other men.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The Moghul examined him carefully for a long moment.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;If you are not like other men, then I will let you
prove it.&quot; Arangbar pointed beyond the marble porticoes. &quot;Will you
fight with the lion?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The Pathan commander turned and stared blankly into the
sunlit square, where the captured lion was snarling and pawing at its chains.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;A lion is a wild beast, Your Majesty. What trial is it
for a man to contest with a lion?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I think it would be the best trial of all.&quot;
Arangbar's eyes began to glow.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;A beast has no understanding, Majesty.&quot; He shifted
nervously as he realized Arangbar was not jesting. &quot;It's not a fit thing
for a man to fight.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You will joust with him.&quot; The fancy seemed to
flood Arangbar with pleasure, and he turned abruptly to one of the guards.
&quot;Give him a glove and a truncheon. That should suffice for a man who
claims bravery above all others.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth watched in disbelief as the dazed commander was
led from the <i>Diwan-i-Am</i> and into the quadrangle. A murmur of amazement
passed through the crowd.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The square cleared quickly as the lion was brought forward by
its keepers. Still incredulous, the Pathan slowly pulled the heavy glove onto
his left hand, then he took the truncheon, no more than a foot and a half long,
in his right. Guards took his swords and turban and in moments he and the lion
were faced off in the afternoon sunshine.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth forced himself to watch as the commander began to
spar with the lion, a young male with powerful claws. He managed to cudgel the
lion several times, with the effect that it became more enraged than harmed.
Then with a roar it sprang, pulling free of its keepers, and they went down
together, rolling in the dust of the square.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The Pathan continued to bravely cudgel the lion, even while
its claws ripped across his face and arms. Hawksworth watched the lion's hard
tail whip for balance as it pawed again and again at the truncheon. Suddenly
the man pulled free of its grasp and, with a wide arcing swing, brought the
truncheon directly across the crown of the lion's head. Its rear haunches
clawed upward spastically and then it pitched unconscious into the bloody dust,
its body still twitching.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>A cheer rose from the crowd of onlookers as the Pathan slowly
drew himself erect. Hawksworth realized that the right side of his face had
been completely ripped away by the lion's sharp claws. He made a few halting
steps toward the <i>Diwan-i-Am</i>, wheeled dizzily, and collapsed in a pool of
blood. He was dead by the time the guards reached him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Arangbar had watched in spellbound delight. He clapped his
hands and turned to Parwaz, whose glazed eyes seemed not to have fully
comprehended the spectacle.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Astounding. I never knew a man could kill a lion with a
mere club. He was braver than he knew. If he has sons, I will allow them to
keep half his estate.&quot; Arangbar turned to the guard captain standing by
the curtained entrance. &quot;Tomorrow select ten of your best men and we will
bring more lions. What better test of bravery?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The uniformed men standing at attention around the perimeter
of the <i>Diwan-i-Am</i> all blanched but their eyes remained fixed straight
ahead. Then Arangbar suddenly remembered Hawksworth.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Does England have men as brave as ours,
Ambassador?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth felt a cold sweat in his palms.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;No man in England would dare challenge one of Your
Majesty's lions.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Arangbar laughed loudly. Before he could respond, the <i>wazir</i>
was whispering in his ear. He glanced at the marble screen directly behind his
throne and nodded. Then he turned to Hawksworth.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We are called away, Ambassador. I'm told I must take my
afternoon rest. This is the time of day I retire to the <i>zenana</i> for one <i>pahar</i>.&quot;
He winked and gestured toward the marble screen. &quot;Her Majesty rules our
time. But I want to speak more with you today about this island of England. And
about your king's schedule for trade. You will attend me in the Diwan-i-Khas
this evening.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;As Your Majesty pleases.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As Arangbar rose his eye caught the painting. He picked it up
and scrutinized it, then turned to Hawksworth.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Is this a fair example of Inglish painting?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It came from the school of a celebrated artist, Your
Majesty. His Majesty, King James, sat to have it painted especially for
you.&quot; Hawksworth sensed that Arangbar had taken more interest in the
painting than in any of the other gifts, except perhaps the hat. &quot;The
painters of England are the finest in the world.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The Moghul stirred slightly and then summoned a small, wiry
man with heavy brows from the first row of courtiers. He briskly moved to the
front and salaamed to Arangbar. The Moghul passed the painting to him and
together they studied it, conversing quietly in Persian. Then Arangbar turned
to Hawksworth.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We have a school of artists here in the palace,
Ambassador Khawksworth. This man, who directs the school, says this portrait's
background is too dark, the eyes lifeless. And it is neither three-quarter nor
full face, as is our proven convention. Consequently it gives no sense of your king's
depth of character.&quot; Arangbar smiled. &quot;He also says the portraits he
and his men execute are far more difficult. They catch the soul of the man, not
merely his physical likeness.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;May it please Your Majesty, I cannot accept what he
says.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Arangbar translated to the artist, who replied quickly in
Persian, casting a quick, contemptuous glance at Hawksworth.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;He declares he could easily duplicate this simple
portrait of your king, in a likeness so exact you could not tell his copy from
the original.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Such a thing is not possible, Your Majesty. No man in
the world could execute this exact painting, save the man who first put in on
paper.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Arangbar again translated for his painter, who replied
animatedly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;My Chief Painter says he and his workshop could easily</span></p>

European painting is a centuries' old tradition, requiring years of

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:22.5pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

unsure of the protocol of betting with kings.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:22.5pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then if you'll not wager with me, wager with my

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:22.5pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then wager with my prime minister.&quot; He turned to

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:22.5pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:22.5pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth swallowed hard, realizing the amount was almost
ten thousand pounds English sterling, more money than he had ever seen.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:22.5pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Money is not an honorable bet among those who speak for
great princes, Your Majesty.&quot; Hawksworth glanced about wildly, then an
idea came. &quot;But perhaps I could wager your prime minister a horse, a fine
Arabian stallion.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:22.5pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:22.5pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:22.5pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:22.5pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

with a flourish to leave. Around Hawksworth the nobles all bowed to the ground.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:22.5pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

&quot;Ambassador Hawksworth, His Majesty has asked me to ensure you are wanting
in nothing while you wait.&quot; Nadir Sharif was standing on the wide marble
balcony when Hawksworth emerged from the stairs that led upward from the <i>Diwan-i-Am</i>
to the interior courtyard of the palace. He salaamed with practiced dignity even
as his darting eyes assessed Hawksworth in a quick sweep. &quot;As prime
minister for His Majesty it is my duty, indeed my pleasure, to attend your
comfort and acquaint you with our protocol.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I thank you on behalf of His Majesty, King James.&quot;
Hawksworth awkwardly tried to salaam in return, careful not to bend as low as
the prime minister.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Perhaps I can begin by acquainting you with the
palace.&quot; He gestured toward the open courtyard, where workmen thronged
installing marble fountains, and the rest of the encircling second-story
balcony. &quot;The stalls below us are where the wives of merchants sometimes
come to offer finery to the women of the <i>zenana</i>. Now they are being
readied for His Majesty's birthday celebration. And there, across the
way&quot;—he pointed to a massive silk canopy covering a pavilion opposite the
square, on the riverside of the palace— &quot;is the <i>Diwan-i-Khas</i>, where
His Majesty holds his evening gatherings. To the left are His Majesty's baths
and on the right, projecting out over the river, is the Jasmine Tower of Queen
Janahara. Now please follow me. His Majesty has honored you by inviting you to
wait for him in the <i>Diwan-i- Khas</i>. The only other <i>feringhis </i>ever
to see it are the Jesuits he sometimes invites here to debate with the
mullahs.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Around them the marble porticoes had been carved in relief, a
profusion of flowers and vines, creating a monochromatic garden in stone. The
floors were patterned marble and the walls decorated with hanging tapestries.
As they entered the <i>Diwan-i-Khas, </i>Hawksworth noticed its floor was
covered with a vast Persian carpet, over which had been scattered bolsters and
pillows for lounging. On the side nearest the interior square was a foot-high
platform in white marble and on the opposite side, facing a gallery overlooking
the arena below and the Jamuna River beyond, was a similar platform in black
marble. Both were padded with rich carpets.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;His Majesty uses the white throne in evenings, and the
black in the afternoons, when he sometimes comes here to watch elephant fights
in the square below. The doorway there leads to Her Majesty's apartments.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Where is His Majesty now?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;He has retired to the <i>zenana </i>for one <i>pahar</i>,
three hours, where he dines on roasted meats, some wine, and passes the time
agreeably. Each afternoon Her Majesty selects a woman for him.&quot; Moghul
smiled. &quot;Naturally it's never the same one. Her Majesty is always first in
his heart, but she never allows his wanton affections to wander. Afterward he
comes here for his evening gathering.&quot; Nadir Sharif walked to the gallery
and looked down on the river. Far below, on the opposite bank, a caravan of
heavily loaded camels passed silently. &quot;By the way, His Majesty has asked
me to inquire if you have a lodging yet, Ambassador.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I have references for brokers, and tomorrow I'll begin
to look.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And personal servants?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'd hoped they'd be provided with the house.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;His Majesty may wish to arrange lodgings for you.&quot;
Nadir Sharif turned back toward Hawksworth and paused for a moment before
continuing. &quot;In Agra ambassadors must acquire their lodgings and servants
with care. There is, regrettably, a certain amount of intrigue in our city.
Trustworthy and efficient servants are not always the easiest thing to find.
Perhaps I should raise the matter of your lodging and servants with His
Majesty.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;There's no reason to trouble His Majesty. I'll contact
the</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>brokers
tomorrow.&quot; Hawksworth's tone was level but firm, suspecting that any
servants picked for him would be spies. And if they turned out to be
&quot;trustworthy and efficient&quot; rather than lazy and begrudging, there
would be no doubt.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The matter rests with His Majesty.&quot; Nadir Sharif
watched as a eunuch entered bearing a tray with glasses of <i>sharbat</i>. A <i>sarangi
</i>player followed him and settled in the corner, striking up a mournful-sounding
tune on an instrument that looked like a bloated violin and sounded, to
Hawksworth, like a distressed cat.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Have you engaged an agent yet, Ambassador?&quot; Nadir
Sharif directed the tray toward Hawksworth.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What do you mean?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;If your king wishes to trade large quantities of
commodity, he will certainly require an agent here in Agra. To ensure that
documents and approvals are handled efficiently.&quot; Nadir Sharif sighed.
&quot;Officials here naturally prefer to work with someone who understands
their . . . requirements. An agent will be essential, if your king expects to
trade heavily.&quot; Nadir Sharif paused. &quot;I presume that is his
intention, assuming His Majesty approves the <i>firman</i>?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth examined Nadir Sharif for a moment, assuming he
was offering to be the agent for King James. Or was he merely hoping to elicit
trade information to pass on to the Portuguese.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'll engage an agent when the time seems proper. For
now I have no <i>firman</i>.&quot; Then a light suddenly dawned somewhere in
Hawksworth's brain. &quot;But I suppose I'll need an 'agent' for that as
well?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It could prove useful. His Majesty can be distressingly
absentminded.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And what would be this agent's fee?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;It depends on the difficulty involved.&quot;
Nadir Sharif’s face remained impassive.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I would say it also depends on whether he's
successful.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;So it would. But he would need more information on
English trading intentions than you have divulged so far.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That will come in time, when I know more about the
'agent.'&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Naturally.&quot; Nadir Sharif cleared his throat.
&quot;But enough</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>of affairs.
Permit me to toast your arrival. When your request for a safe-conduct pass
arrived from Surat, we all wondered if a <i>feringhi </i>new to India could
successfully travel our bandit-infested roads, even with the Moghul’s
pass.&quot; He took a delicate sip of the beverage. &quot;I trust your journey
was without mishap.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;For the most part.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;A diplomatic answer. But you seem to have survived all
parts well enough. Did you take the Burhanpur road?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I did.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Ah, then perhaps you passed Prince Jadar. I understand
he was there recently.&quot; Nadir Sharif smiled disarmingly. &quot;I always
welcome news of him. You may know he's married to my first daughter, Mumtaz. I
hear she just presented him with his first son.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;He was in Burhanpur when I arrived. But I was only there
for three days.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Not a very interesting city, I'm told. But they say the
Deccan itself is quite beautiful in harvest. I envy you your trip. I, alas,
rarely can escape Agra, except when His Majesty goes to Kashmir in the heat of
summer.&quot; Nadir Sharif signaled the eunuch to refill Hawksworth's cup. The <i>sarangi
</i>player had been joined by a drummer, who took up a slow, even rhythm.
&quot;Did I understand you to say you met the prince while you were
there?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth hesitated and studied Nadir Sharif, not remembering
he had mentioned meeting Jadar. &quot;Actually I did see him briefly once. He
was in the fortress, where I stayed.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Ah yes, the fortress. That was wise of you, considering
the situation now. I'm pleased he invited you to join him.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;As it happened, I traveled from Surat with men from his
guard. Their destination was the fortress.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;His guards? Then you were most fortunate indeed.&quot;
Nadir Sharif seemed to listen absently to the melody for a moment. &quot;I'm
always a bit stupid about military campaigns. What would men from his guards be
doing in Surat?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth heard an inner alarm suddenly sound. &quot;I think
they were there to accompany a convoy.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;A convoy? From Surat? Odd. But then I rarely understand
these things. What was it bringing?&quot; Nadir Sharif chuckled congenially.
&quot;Barrels of Persian wine for the prince, I would venture to guess?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I understand it was lead for shot.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Nadir Sharif gave Hawksworth a quick, troubled glance.
&quot;I see. Yes, lead would require a guard. But Prince Jadar's Rajputs
virtually scorn to use muskets, so I assume it was rather a small number of
carts.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth straightened his doublet, shifting the location of
Vasant Rao's katar. &quot;I don't recall the precise number.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Naturally. I'm confused by numbers myself. Probably
something like twenty, I suppose. Certainly, I would presume, no more than
fifty?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I didn't count the exact number.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Too many to count? I see.&quot; Nadir Sharif seemed to
be only half attentive to the conversation, as he swung his head from side to
side in appreciation of the accelerating tempo of the drummer. &quot;Doubtless
it was some of the very lead I'm told you brought for trade.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It wasn't English.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Ah, then I suppose it was Portuguese. I assume you must
have noticed.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Not actually.&quot; Hawksworth paused. &quot;It wasn't
really my concern.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Yes, quite so.&quot; Nadir Sharif walked again to the
gallery and stood silent, still swinging his head absently to the time of the
music. The pieces of the puzzle had already dropped into place.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>So that's how Jadar did it. And only one man in Surat could
have provided the prince the silver he needed, that contemptible son of a
moneylender Mirza Nuruddin. He's uncontrollable. But even if the prince
survives the Deccan, what can he do? The Imperial army . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Allah, it's obvious! There's only one way he can ever march
north with enough men to meet Janahara's army. By the Merciful Prophet, he's
mad!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Nadir Sharif coughed lightly and turned back toward the</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>room.
&quot;Ambassador Hawksworth, would you care for some wine? You need not be
squeamish, His Majesty has always admired men who drink. I would join you, but
regrettably I cannot. While His Majesty retires, the rest of us must labor
on.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;A glass would be welcome.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;A glass, Ambassador? Did you say 'a glass'?&quot; Nadir
Sharif laughed. &quot;You'll need more than a glass if you drink with His
Majesty. I'll send the servants.&quot; He bowed again at the doorway of the
vestibule. &quot;I'll rejoin you when I can. In the meantime, summon the
eunuchs if you require anything.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He turned and was gone. In what seemed only moments, two
turbaned servants appeared, smiling as they placed a large chalice of wine on
the carpet next to Hawksworth's bolster.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It's all too incredible.&quot; Queen Janahara slumped
onto a velvet divan and distractedly took a rolled betel leaf from the silver
tray offered by a hovering eunuch. Behind her a female <i>zenana </i>slave
fanned a plume of peacock feathers against the afternoon heat. As she spoke she
brushed back her gold-threaded scarf, revealing gleaming dark hair—the few gray
strands had been perfectly dyed—pulled back tightly against her head and
secured with a golden band. Her only jewels were in a necklace, diamonds with a
massive blue sapphire that complemented her dark eyes. She was nearing fifty,
but still possessed of a beauty that had, with the years, evolved to
magnificent dignity. Her face was statuesque and her Persian was both elegant
and mellifluous. &quot;He's still marching south. I think he actually enjoys
living in the field, surrounded by mud and Rajputs. How much longer can he
continue?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Be assured this time the prince will bring his own
undoing.&quot; Nadir Sharif accepted a betel leaf from the tray, a gesture, and
absently rolled it between his thumb and finger. He wondered nervously why she
had summoned him to the Jasmine Tower the minute he left the English <i>feringhi</i>.
He normally enjoyed meeting her there, amid the marble screens, where they
could recline on the carpeted terrace and admire the broad Jamuna. As her
brother and prime minister, it was not unseemly for him to visit her in her
quarters. &quot;The campaign in the Deccan will change everything, Your
Majesty. It cannot end as did the last one, with Malik Ambar surrendering out
of fright. The Abyssinian surely suspects by now that Jadar is isolated.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Queen Janahara was no longer listening. Her thoughts were
seething over the two surprises of the day. The first was Nadir Sharif’s
absence from her historic appearance at the <i>darshan </i>balcony. She had
already been informed of his absence by four separate eunuchs. All assumed it
was deliberate.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Nadir Sharif. My own brother. Can he be wavering? Or merely
bargaining?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Why? Has something happened with Jadar? The march south
should have been the end of him. The <i>mansabdars </i>and their troops south
of the Narbada were in shambles. But somehow Jadar has managed to recall enough
cavalry to continue his campaign. What is he planning?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>That question called to mind the second problem of the day.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The Englishman.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She knew, as Arangbar did not, that the Englishman had
already met with Jadar. Why had Jadar contrived such a meeting? The prince must
know that both she and Nadir Sharif had full support of the Viceroy of Goa. Did
he also know that the Viceroy had even offered secretly to help arm the
Deccanis against him, an arrangement she was now negotiating?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>What of the English <i>feringhi</i>, his letter, his meeting
with Jadar? She had studied him carefully through her screen when he appeared
at the afternoon <i>durbar </i>and she had ordered a Persian translation of his
letter prepared immediately. And what she read was disturbing. The English king
had, it was true, asked merely for a trading <i>firman</i>. But who knew what
sea power waited behind the English appearance at Surat?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She knew Jadar despised Christians, but he would not scruple
to use them one against the other. Where would it lead, if Jadar could enlist
English sea power in the struggle that loomed ahead, and somehow neutralize the
influence of the Portuguese? Maddeningly, the Moghul seemed amused by the
Englishman, by his rude manner.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Why did His Majesty invite the <i>feringhi </i>to the <i>Diwan-i-
Khas </i>tonight?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;My esteemed sister, you were at today's durbar. You
know His Majesty's whims far better than I. Perhaps he was fascinated by
finding a <i>feringhi </i>who speaks his barbarous Turki. For His Majesty the
new <i>feringhi </i>cannot be anything more than merely a new toy, like a new
dog or horse. He will amuse himself with the <i>feringhi</i>, dangle promises
before him, and wait to see if more gifts are forthcoming. You know he is the
same with all ambassadors.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;This one I think is different. Did you see him refuse
to <i>teslim</i>? I think His Majesty is already awed by him. I fear for India
if the English ever gain influence here. Do you really believe the English king
wants nothing more than trade?&quot; Janahara found herself searching for the
key to Nadir Sharifs thoughts. &quot;What do you suppose would happen if these
English defy the Portuguese and one day decide to blockade Surat? To allow
trade only to those who have supported them at court.&quot; She paused as she
studied him. &quot;Could there be some here already who are fearful enough to
pretend friendship to the Englishman?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Who could know these things?&quot; Nadir Sharif walked
to the white marble railing and gazed along the side of the fort, where the
Jamuna lapped gently against the thick red walls. He remembered his pigeons,
and then he remembered the morning <i>darshan</i> and Janahara's unprecedented
appearance.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The Englishman is hardly a problem, my dear sister. He is
already tamed. You are the problem now. You and your newfound power. But if you
fear this harmless <i>feringhi</i> more than you fear me, then I have at last
found a way to manage you as well. At long last.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Tonight I will drink with the English <i>feringhi</i>,
and then we may learn something useful. A man lounging with a wine cup in his
hands says things he would never utter standing at <i>durbar</i>. I think His
Majesty may also be wondering about the intentions of his king.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Janahara chewed silently on the betel leaf and eyed him,
knowing he had met that morning with the Rajput who brought the English <i>feringhi
</i>to Agra and wondering why. Whatever the reason, she told herself, Nadir
Sharif would never be so foolish as to side with Jadar. Not so long as the
prince was isolated and weak. Nadir Sharif did not gamble.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The <i>feringhi </i>must be watched closely. Find a
way. We need to know what he is doing, what he is thinking. Do you
understand?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;To hear is to obey.&quot; Nadir Sharif bowed lightly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And you will be at <i>darshan </i>tomorrow morning.
Even if you were not there today.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Naturally had I but known, Majesty . . .&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Father made you prime minister. You can be just as
easily removed.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;Your Majesty.&quot; Nadir Sharif bowed, and
with an unseen flick sent the rolled betel leaf spinning past the railing,
toward the dark waters of the Jamuna below.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth sipped from the new cup of wine, his third, and
watched the musicians begin to retune. Around him the members of Arangbar's
inner circle were assembling in the <i>Diwan-i-Khas</i>. This must be evening
dress in Agra, he marveled: silk turbans studded with rubies and sapphires,
diamond earrings, swords trimmed in gold and silver, pearl necklaces, cloaks of
rich brocade, velvet slippers. The faces around him all betrayed the indolent
eyes and pasty cheeks of men long indulged in rich food, hard spirits,
sensuality.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It was, he now realized, the fairyland that Symmes had
described that freezing day so long ago in the offices of the Levant Company.
What man not a Papist monk could resist the worldly seductions of the Moghul’s
court?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then he remembered the brave Pathan who had been torn apart
by a lion that very afternoon, while all Arangbar's nobles watched
unprotesting.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>On the signal of a eunuch standing by the doorway the</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>drummer
suddenly pounded out a loud, rhythmic fanfare, and then the sitarist took up a
martial motif. The brocade drapery hanging inside a marble archway at the back
of the room was drawn aside by a guard and a moment later Arangbar swept into
the room. The courtiers all bowed in the <i>teslim</i>, rising with their hands
on their forehead.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Arangbar had changed to evening dress. He wore a dark velvet
turban encrusted with jewels, tight-fitting patterned trousers beneath a
transparent muslin skirt, and a gold brocade cinch at his waist. He clapped his
hands in delight when he saw Hawksworth holding a wine cup.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The ambassador has already tasted our Persian wine. How
do you find it, Ambassador . . . Khaw . . . ?&quot; He stumbled over the name.
&quot;Wait. The first thing we must do is rename you. Henceforth we will call
you 'Inglish.' Now, have we pronounced that properly?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Perfectly, Your Majesty. And, so please Your Majesty,
the wine is excellent, though perhaps not as sweet as the wines of
Europe.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Every <i>feringhi </i>says the same, Inglish. But we
will civilize you. And also teach you something about painting.&quot; He seized
a glass of wine from a waiting eunuch and then shouted to Nadir Sharif, who had
entered moments before from the back. &quot;Where are my five paintings?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm told they will be ready before Your Majesty
retires. The painters are still hard at work, so please Your Majesty.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It does not please me, but then I have no wager.&quot;
He roared with amusement. &quot;Your stables will be reduced by a prize
stallion come morning if the paintings are not ready soon. Look to it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As Nadir Sharif bowed in acknowledgment, Arangbar whirled to
Hawksworth.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Tell me something about your king, Inglish? How many
wives does he have? We have hundreds.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;He has but one, Your Majesty, and I believe she is
mostly for show. King James prefers the company of young men.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Very like most Christians I've met. And you, Inglish.
Have you any wives?&quot; Arangbar had already finished his first glass of wine
and taken a second.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I have none, Your Majesty.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But you, I suspect, are not a Jesuit, or a
eunuch.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;No, Your Majesty.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then we shall find you a wife, Inglish.&quot; He took a
ball of opium and washed it down with wine. &quot;No, we will find you two.
Yes, you shall be well wived.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;May it please Your Majesty, I have no means to care for
a wife. I am here for only a season.&quot; Hawksworth shifted uncomfortably.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You will only leave Agra, Inglish, when it is our
pleasure. But if you will not have a wife, you must at least have a
house.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I am arranging it now, Your Majesty.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Arangbar looked at Hawksworth sharply, then continued as
though he had not heard.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Now tell us more about your king. We would know what
he's like.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth bowed as he tried to collect his thoughts. The
wine was already toying with his brain. Although most of what he knew about
King James was hearsay, he knew he did not care for England's new king overly
much. No English subject did. And idle seamen had reason to dislike him the
most of all. He was not the sovereign Elizabeth had been.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;He's of middle stature, Your Majesty, not overly fat
though he seems so since he always wears quilted, stiletto-proof
doublets.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Arangbar seemed surprised. &quot;Is he not safe? Has he no
guards?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;He's a prudent man, Your Majesty, as befits a
sovereign.&quot; And, Hawksworth thought, also a coward, if you believe the
talk in London. What all men know for fact, though, is that he's a weakling,
whose legs are so spindly he has to be helped to walk, leaning on other men's
shoulders while he fiddles spastically with his codpiece.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Does your king wear many jewels, Ambassador
Inglish?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Of course, Your Majesty.&quot; Hawksworth drank calmly
from his wine cup, hoping the lie would pass unnoticed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>What would the Moghul think if he knew the truth, Hawksworth
asked himself? That King James of England only changes his clothes when they
are rags, and his fashion never. He was once, they say, given a Spanish-style
hat, and he cast it away, swearing he loved neither them nor their fashions.
Another time he was given shoes with brocade roses on them, and he railed at
the giver, asking if he was to be made a ruff-footed dove.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;Is your king generous of nature, Ambassador?
We are loved by our people because we give of our bounty on every holy day.
Baskets of silver rupees are flung down the streets of Agra.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;King James is giving also, Your Majesty.&quot; With the
moneys of others. He'd part willingly with a hundred pounds not in his own keeping
before he'd release ten shillings from his private purse. And it's said he'd
rather spend a hundred thousand pounds on embassies abroad, buying peace with
bribes, than ten thousand on an army that would enforce peace with honor.
&quot;He is a man among men, Your Majesty, admired and loved by all his
subjects.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;As are we, Ambassador.&quot; Arangbar took another ball
of opium and washed it down with a third glass of wine. &quot;Tell me, does
your king drink spirits?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It is said he drinks often, Your Majesty, though many
declare it is more out of custom than delight. He drinks strong
liquors—Frontiniack, Canary, High Canary wine, Tent wine, Scottish ale—but
never, it's said, more than a few spoonfuls.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then he could never drink with the Moghul of India,
Ambassador. We have twenty cups of wine a night. And twelve grains of
opium.&quot; Arangbar paused as he accepted yet another glass. His voice had
begun to slur slightly. &quot;But perhaps your king can trade with me. When
will the ships from your king's next voyage arrive? And how many of your king's
frigates will we see yearly if we grant him the trading <i>firman </i>he
requests?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Hawksworth noticed out of the corner of his eye that
Nadir Sharif had now moved directly beside him. The prime minister held a glass
of wine from which he sipped delicately. Around him the other courtiers were
already drinking heavily, to the obvious approval of Arangbar.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He'll not finish a single glass of wine, if my guess is
right. Nadir Sharif’ll find a way to stay stone sober while the rest of the
room sinks into its cups. And they'll all be too drunk to notice.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;King James will one day send an armada of frigates,
Your Majesty.&quot; Keep Arangbar's mind off the next voyage. He just may try
to hold you here until it comes, or refuse to grant a <i>firman </i>until he sees
the next batch of presents. &quot;His Majesty, King James, is always eager to
trade the seas where his ships are welcome.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Even if other nations of Europe would quarrel with his
rights to those seas?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;England has no quarrels in Europe, Your Majesty. If you
refer to the engagement off Surat, you should know that was caused by a
misunderstanding of the treaties that now exist in Europe. England is at peace
with all her neighbors.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>A skeptical silence seemed to envelop the room. Arangbar took
another cup of wine and drank it off. Then he turned to Hawksworth.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The matter, Ambassador Inglish, does not seem to us to
be that simple. But we will examine it more later. Nights are made for beauty,
days for affairs of state.&quot; Arangbar's voice had begun to slur even more
noticeably. &quot;You may have heard there will be a wedding here soon. My
youngest prince is betrothed to the daughter of my queen. The wedding will be
held one month after my own birthday celebration, and it will be an event to
remember. Tonight I begin the always-pleasant task of selecting the women who
will dance. Do you know anything of Indian dance?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Very little, Your Majesty. I have only seen it once. In
Surat. At a gathering one evening at the palace of the Shahbandar.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Arangbar roared and seized another glass of wine. &quot;I can
well imagine the kind of entertainment the Shahbandar of Surat provides for his
guests. No, Ambassador, I mean the real dance of India. The dance of great
artists? Perhaps you have classical dance in England?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;No, Your Majesty. We have nothing similar. At least
similar to the dance I saw.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then a pleasant surprise awaits you.&quot; Arangbar
examined Hawksworth's cup and motioned for a servant to refill it. &quot;Drink
up, Inglish. The evening is only beginning.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Arangbar clapped drunkenly and the guests began to settle
themselves around the bolsters that had been strewn about the carpet. An ornate
silk pillow was provided for each man to rest against, and a number of large
hookahs, each with several mouthpieces, were lighted and stationed about the
room. The servants also distributed garlands of yellow flowers, and as Nadir
Sharif took his place next to Hawksworth, he wrapped one of the garlands about
his left wrist. With the other hand he set down his wineglass, still full, and
signaled a servant to replenish Hawksworth's. Arangbar was reclining now on the
throne, against his own bolster, and the oil lamps around the side of the room
were lowered, leaving illumination only on the musicians and on a bare spot in
the center of the carpet. The air was rich with the aroma of roses as servants
passed shaking rosewater on the guests from long-necked silver decanters.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The musicians were completing their tuning, and Hawksworth
noticed that now there were two drummers, a sitar player, and a new musician
holding a <i>sarangi</i>. In the background another man sat methodically
strumming a simple upright instrument, shaped like the sitar save it provided
nothing more than a low-pitched droning, against which the other instruments
had been tuned. Next a man entered, wearing a simple white shirt, and settled
himself on the carpet in front of the musicians. As silence gripped the room,
Arangbar signaled to the seated man with his wineglass and the man began to
sing a low, soulful melody that seemed to consist of only a few syllables.
&quot;Ga, Ma, Pa.&quot; The voice soared upward. &quot;Da, Ni, Sa.&quot; After
a few moments Hawksworth guessed he must be singing the names of the notes in
the Indian scale. They were virtually identical to the Western scale, except
certain notes seemed to be a few microtones higher or lower, depending whether
approached from ascent or descent.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The singer's voice soared slowly upward in pitch and
volume, growing more intense as it quavered around certain of the high notes,
while the sarangi player listened attentively and bowed the exact notes he
sang, always seeming to guess which note he would find next. The song was
melodic, and gradually what had at first seemed almost a dirge grew to be a
poignant line of beauty.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Suddenly the singer's voice cut the air with a fast-tempo
phrase, which was brief and immediately repeated, the second time to the
accompaniment of the drum, as both players picked up the notes. On the third
repetition of the phrase, the curtains on Arangbar's right were swept aside and
a young woman seemed to fairly burst across the room, her every skipping step
announced by a band of tiny bells bound around her ankles and across the tops
of her bare feet.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As she spun into the light, she whirled a fast pirouette that
sent her long braided pigtail—so long the end was attached to her
waist—whistling in an arc behind her. Her flowered silk tunic flew outward from
her spinning body, revealing all of her tight-fitting white trousers. She wore
a crown of jewels, straight pendant earrings of emerald, and an inch- long
string of diamonds dangled from the center of her nose.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She paused for an instant, whirled toward Arangbar, and
performed a <i>salaam </i>with her right hand, fingers slightly bent, thumb
across her palm as she raised her hand to her forehead. The movement was
possessed of so much grace it seemed a perfect dance figure.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;May I take the liberty of interpreting for you,
Ambassador?&quot; Nadir Sharif ignored the hookah mouthpiece that another,
slightly tipsy, guest was urging on him and slid closer to Hawksworth.
&quot;Kathak is an art, like painting or pigeon-flying, best appreciated when
you know the rules.&quot; He pointed toward the dancer. &quot;Her name is
Sangeeta, and she has just performed the invocation. For the Hindus it is a
salute to their elephant-headed god Ganesh. For Muslims, it is a <i>salaam</i>.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Next she turned slowly toward the guests and struck a pose,
one foot crossed behind the other, arms bent as though holding a drawn bow. As
the <i>sarangi </i>played a slow, tuneful melody, she seemed to control the
rhythm of the drums by quietly stroking together again and again the thumb and
forefinger of each hand. The explosive tension in her body seemed focused
entirely in this single, virtually imperceptible motion, almost as a glass
marshals the power of the sun to a tiny point. Then her eyes began to dart from
side to side, and first one eyebrow and then the other lifted seductively.
Gradually the rhythm was taken up by her head, as it began to glide from side
to side in a subtle, elegant expression that seemed an extension of the music.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She had possessed the room almost as a spirit of pure dance,
chaste, powerful, disciplined, and there was nothing of the overt
suggestiveness of the nautch dancers of the Shahbandar's courtyard. She wore a
low-cut, tight vest of brocade over a long-sleeved silk shirt, and of her body
only her hands, feet, and face were visible. It was these, Hawksworth realized,
not her body, that were the elements of Kathak dance.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Now she'll begin the second section of the dance. It's
the introduction and corresponds to the opening of a raga. It sets the
atmosphere and makes you long for more. I know of no <i>feringhi </i>who has
ever seen Kathak, but perhaps you can understand. Do you feel it?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth sipped his wine slowly and tried to clear his
head. In truth he felt very little, save the intensity that seemed to be held
in check.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It appears to be rather subtle. Very little seems to be
happening.&quot; Hawksworth drank again and found himself longing for a lively
hornpipe.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;A great deal will happen, Ambassador, and very soon. In
India you must learn patience.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Almost at that moment the drummers erupted with a dense
rhythmic cycle and the <i>sarangi </i>took up a single repetitive phrase.
Sangeeta looked directly at Hawksworth and called out a complex series of rhythmic
syllables, in a melodic if slightly strident voice, all the while duplicating
the exact pattern of sounds by slapping the henna-reddened soles of her feet
against the carpet. Then she glided across the carpet in a series of syncopated
foot movements, saluting each of the guests in turn and calling out strings of
syllables, after which she would dance a sequence that replicated the rhythm
exactly, her feet a precise percussion instrument.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The syllables she recites are called <i>bols</i>,
Ambassador, which are the names of the many different strokes on the tabla
drums. Drummers sometimes call out a sequence before they play it. She does the
same, except she uses her feet almost as a drummer uses his hands.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As Hawksworth watched, Sangeeta called strings of syllables
that were increasingly longer and more complex. He could not understand the <i>bols</i>,
or perceive the rhythms as she danced them, but the drunken men around him were
smiling and swinging their heads from side to side in what he took to be
appreciative approval. Suddenly Arangbar shouted something to her and pointed
toward the first drummer. The drummer beamed, nodded, and as Sangeeta watched,
called out a dense series of <i>bols</i>. Then she proceeded to dance the
sequence with her feet. The room exploded with cries of appreciation when she
finished the sequence, and Hawksworth assumed she had managed to capture the
instructions the musician had called. Then Arangbar pointed to the other
drummer and he also called out a string of <i>bols</i>, which again Sangeeta
repeated. Finally the singer called a rhythm sequence, the most complex yet,
and both dancer and drummer repeated them precisely together.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As the tempo became wilder, Sangeeta began a series of
lightning spins, still pounding the carpet with her reddened soles, and in time
she seemed to transform into a whirling top, her pigtail loose now and singing
through the air like a deadly whip. She had become a blur, and for a brief
moment she appeared to have two heads. Hawksworth watched in wonder and sipped
from his wine cup.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Now she'll begin the last part, Ambassador, the most
demanding of all.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The rhythm became almost a frenzy now. Then as suddenly as
they had begun the whirls ended. Sangeeta struck a statuesque pose, arms
extended in rigid curves, and began a display of intensely rhythmic footwork.
Her body seemed frozen in space as nothing moved save her feet. The bells on
her ankles became a continuous chime, increasing in tempo with the drum and the
<i>sarangi </i>until the rhythmic phrase itself was nothing more than a dense
blur of notes, Suddenly the drummer and instrumentalist fell silent, conceding
the room to Sangeeta's whirring bells. She seemed, at the last, to be treading
on pure air, her feet almost invisible. When the intensity of her rhythm became
almost unbearable, the drummers and <i>sarangi </i>player reentered, urging the
excitement to a crescendo. A final phrase was introduced, repeated with greater
intensity, and then a third and final time, ending with a powerful crash on the
large drum that seemed to explode the tension in the room. Several of the
musicians cried out involuntarily, almost orgasmically, in exultation. In the
spellbound silence that followed, the nobles around Hawksworth burst into
cheers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Sangeeta seemed near collapse as she bowed to Arangbar. The
Moghul smiled broadly, withdrew a velvet purse of coins from his cloak, and
threw it at her feet. Moments later several others in the room followed suit.
With a second bow she scooped the purses from the carpet and vanished through
the curtains. The cheers followed her long after she was gone.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What do you think, Ambassador? You know half the men
here would give a thousand gold <i>mohurs </i>to have her tonight.&quot; Nadir
Sharif beamed mischievously. &quot;The other half two thousand.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Come forward.&quot; Arangbar motioned to the singer
sitting on the carpet. He was, Hawksworth now realized, an aging, portly man
with short white hair and a painful limp. As he approached Arangbar's dais, he
began removing the tiny cymbals attached to the fingers of one hand that he had
used to keep time for the dancer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;He's her guru, her teacher.&quot; Nadir Sharif pointed
to the man as he bowed obsequiously before the Moghul. &quot;If His Majesty
decides to select Sangeeta to dance at the wedding, his fortune will be made.
Frankly I thought she was good, though there is still a trifle too much flair
in her style, too many tricks. But then she's young, and perhaps it's too soon
to expect genuine maturity. Still, I noticed His Majesty was taken with her.
She could well find herself in the <i>zenana</i> soon.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Arangbar flipped another purse of coins to the man, and then
spoke to him curtly in Persian.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;His Majesty has expressed his admiration, and says he
may call him again after he has seen the other dancers.&quot; Nadir Sharif
winked. &quot;Choosing the dancers is a weighty responsibility. Naturally His
Majesty will want to carefully review all the women.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The lamps brightened again and servants bustled
about the carpet filling glasses and exchanging the burned-out tobacco chillum,
clay bowls at the top of each hookah. When they had finished, Arangbar took
another glass of wine and signaled for the lamps to be lowered once more. A new
group of musicians began filing into the room, carrying instruments Hawksworth
had never before seen. First came the drummer, who carried not the two short
tabla drums but rather a single long instrument, designed to be played at both
ends simultaneously. A singer entered next, already wearing small gold cymbals
on each hand. Finally a third man entered, carrying nothing but a piece of inch-thick
bamboo, less than two feet in length and perforated with a line of holes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Arangbar looked quizzically at Nadir Sharif.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As though reading the question, the prime minister rose and
spoke in Turki. &quot;This one's name is Kamala, Your Majesty. She is originally
from the south, but now she is famous among the Hindus in Agra. Although I have
never seen her dance, I assumed Your Majesty would want to humor the Hindus by
auditioning her.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We are a sovereign of all our subjects. I have never
seen this Hindu dance. Nor these instruments of the south. What are they
called?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The drum is called a mirdanga, Majesty. They use it in
the south with a type of sitar they call the veena. The other instrument is a
bamboo flute.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Arangbar shifted impatiently. &quot;Tell them this should be
brief.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Nadir Sharif spoke quickly to the musicians in a language few
in the room seemed to understand. They nodded and immediately the flautist
began a haunting lyric line that bathed the room in a soft, echoing melody.
Hawksworth was startled that so simple an instrument could produce such rich,
warm tones.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The curtains parted and a tall, elaborately jeweled woman
swept across the carpet. She took command of the space around her, possessed
it, almost as though it were part of her being. Her long silk <i>sari </i>had
been gathered about each leg so that it seemed like trousers, and her every
step was announced by dense bracelets of bells at her ankles. Most striking,
however, was her carriage. Hawksworth had never before seen such dignity of
motion.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As he stared at her, he realized she was wearing an immense,
diamond-encrusted nose ring and long pendant earrings, also of diamonds. Not
even the Moghul wore stones to equal hers. Her face was heavily painted, but
still he suspected she might no longer be in the first bloom of youth. Her
self-assurance was too secure. She knew exactly who she was.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She turned her back to Arangbar as she reverently gave an
invocation, both hands together and raised above her head, to some absent god.
The only sound was the slow, measured cadence of the drum. Suddenly it seemed
as though her body had captured some perfect moment of balance, a feeling of
timelessness within time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth glanced toward Arangbar, whose irritation was
obvious.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>How can she be so imprudent as to ignore him? Aren't Hindus
afraid of him? What was her name? Kamala?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>His eyes shot back to the woman.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Kamala.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Can she be the woman Kali spoke of that last night in Surat?
The Lotus Woman? Nadir Sharif said she was famous.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Just who are you?&quot; Arangbar's voice cut through
the carpeted room, toward the woman's back. He was speaking Turki, and he was
outraged.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Kamala whirled on him. &quot;One who dances for Shiva, in his</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>aspect as
Nataraj, the god of the dance. For him and for him alone.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What do you call this dance for your infidel god?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Bharata Natyam. The dance of the temple. The sacred
tradition as old as India itself. The god Shiva set the world in motion by the
rhythms of his dance. My dance is a prayer to Shiva.&quot; Kamala's eyes
snapped with hatred. &quot;I dance for no one else.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You were summoned here to dance for me.&quot; Arangbar
pulled himself drunkenly erect. Around the room the nobles began to shift
uneasily, their bleary eyes filling with alarm.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then I will not dance. You have the world in your
hands. But you cannot possess the dance of Shiva. Our dance is prescribed in
the Natya Shastra of the ancient sage Bharata. Over a thousand years ago he
declared that dance is not merely for pleasure; dance is the blending of all
art, religion, philosophy. It gives mankind wisdom, discipline, endurance.
Through dance we are allowed to know the totality of all that is. My dance is
not for your sport.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Arangbar's anger increased, but now it was leavened with
puzzlement.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;If you will not dance your Shiva dance, then dance Kathak.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The dance Muslims call Kathak is the perversion of yet
another of our sacred traditions. Perhaps there are some Hindu dancers who
will, for Muslim gold, debase the ancient Kathak dance of India, will make it a
display of empty technique for the amusement of India's oppressors. Muslims
and&quot;—she turned and glared at Hawksworth—&quot;now <i>feringhi</i>. But I
will not do it. The Kathak you want to see is no longer true Kathak. It has
been made empty, without meaning. I will never debase our true Kathak dance for
you, as others have done, any more than I will dedicate a performance of
Bharata Natyam to a mortal man.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The guards near the entrance of the <i>Diwan-i-Khas </i>had
all tensed, their hands dropping uneasily to their swords.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I have heard enough. A man who dared speak to me as you
have would be sent to the elephants. You, I think, deserve more. Since you
speak to your god through dance, you do not need a tongue.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Arangbar turned to summon the waiting guards when, at the
rear of the <i>Diwan-i-Khas</i>, the figure of the Chief Painter emerged, his
assistants trailing behind. They carried a long, thin board.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Nadir Sharif spotted them and immediately leaped to his feet,
almost as though he had been expecting their entrance.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Your Majesty.&quot; He quickly moved between Arangbar and
Kamala, who stood motionless. &quot;The paintings have arrived. I'm ready for
my horse. Let the English ambassador see them now.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Arangbar looked up in confusion, his eyes half closed from
the opium. Then he saw the painters and remembered.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Bring them in.&quot; Suddenly his alertness seemed to
return. &quot;I want to see five Inglish kings.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The paintings were brought to the foot of Arangbar's dais,
and he inspected them drunkenly, but with obvious satisfaction.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Ambassador Inglish. Have a look.&quot; Arangbar called
toward the hushed shadows of the seated guests. A path immediately cleared
among the bolsters, as hookahs were pushed aside, wineglasses seized.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth walked unsteadily forward, his mind still stunned
by the imminent death sentence waiting for the woman. As he passed her, he
sensed her powerful presence and inhaled her musky perfume. There was no hint
of fear in her eyes as she stood waiting, statuesque and defiant.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>By the time he reached the throne, eunuchs were waiting with
candles, one on each side of the board, bathing it in flickering light. On it
was a line of five English miniatures of King James, each approximately an inch
square.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Good Jesus, they're identical. Am I so drunk I can't tell a
painting of King James?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He looked up shakily at Arangbar, whose smile was a gloat.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, Ambassador Inglish. What say you? Are the
painters of my school equal to any your king has?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;One moment, Majesty. Until my eyes adjust.&quot;
Hawksworth grasped one edge of the board to steady himself. Behind him there
were murmurs of delight and he caught the word &quot;<i>feringhi</i>.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As he walked along the board, studying each painting in turn,
he suddenly noticed that the reflection of the candlelight was different for
one.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The paint is still wet on the new portraits. That's the
difference. Or is it? Are my eyes playing tricks? Damn me for letting Nadir
Sharif fill my wineglass every chance he had.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Come, Ambassador Inglish. We do not have all
night.&quot; Arangbar's voice was brimming with triumph.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth studied the paintings more closely. Yes, there's a
slight difference. The colors on the one painting are slightly different.
Duller.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>They didn't use varnish. And there are fewer shadows. Theirs
are more two-dimensional.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm astounded, Your Majesty. But I believe this is the
one by Isaac Oliver.&quot; Hawksworth pointed to the painting second from the
right end.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Let me see them again.&quot; Arangbar's voice was a
husky slur. &quot;I will tell if you have guessed correctly.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The board was handed up. Arangbar glanced at the paintings
for only an instant. &quot;You have guessed right, Ambassador Inglish. And I
realize how you did it. The light from the candles.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The portraits are identical, Your Majesty. I confess
it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;So we have won our point. And you won the wager,
Inglish. Still, you won only because of my haste. Tomorrow you would not have
known. Do you admit it?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I do, Your Majesty.&quot; Hawksworth bowed slightly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;So, you did not really win the wager after all. We lost
it. But I am a man of honor. We will release Nadir Sharif from his pledge. I am
the one who must pay. What would you have? Perhaps a diamond?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The wager was only for a horse, Your Majesty.&quot;
Hawksworth was stunned.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;No. That was the wager of Nadir Sharif. You have won a
wager from a king. Yours must be the payment of a king. If not a jewel, then
what would you have?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Before Hawksworth could reply, Nadir Sharif stepped forward
and bent toward Arangbar.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;If I may be allowed to suggest, Your Majesty,
the <i>feringhi </i>needs a woman. Give him this dancer. Let him amuse himself
with her until you can find a suitable wife for him.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Arangbar looked toward Hawksworth with glazed eyes. It was
obvious he had already forgotten about Kamala.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The Kathak dancer who was here? She was excellent. Yes,
that would be perfect.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Your Majesty of course means the woman standing here
now.&quot; Nadir Sharif directed Arangbar's groggy gaze toward Kamala, who
stood mutely, eyes flashing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;There she is. Of course. What do you say to her,
Inglish?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth was astounded by Nadir Sharifs quickness of wit.
He's saved the woman. He's a genius. Of course I'll take her. Good Jesus,
there's been enough bloodshed today.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The woman would be the gift of a great prince, Your
Majesty.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;So there's manhood about you after all, Inglish. I had
begun to think you were like your king.&quot; Arangbar laughed in delight.
&quot;So it's a woman you would have, Ambassador? Merciful Allah, I have too
many now. Perhaps you would like two. I recall there's an Armenian Christian
somewhere in the <i>zenana</i>. Perhaps several. They're said to be as lusty as
the Portuguese harlots in Goa.&quot; He choked for a moment on laughter.
&quot;Let me summon the eunuchs.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;This one will do for now, Your Majesty.&quot; Think how
to phrase this. &quot;Merely to serve me.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Yes, she will 'serve' you, Ambassador. Or we will have
her head. If she would amuse you, she's yours.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Kamala's look met Hawksworth's. It was strangely without
emotion.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then Arangbar suddenly remembered Kamala's defiance and
turned to study her again with half-closed eyes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But not this one. It must be the other one you want.
This one will be hanged tonight, in a room far beneath the <i>zenana</i>. After
she has answered for her words. Tomorrow her carcass will pollute the Jamuna. A
man in he</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>r place</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> would already be dead.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;May it please Your Majesty, it would satisfy me even
more to have this one.&quot; Hawksworth paused. &quot;Perhaps it's what the
English call honor. We both know I did not win our wager fairly. Only by taking
something of no value, like this woman, could I maintain my honor, and my
king's.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You are persuasive, Inglish, and I am drunk. But not
too drunk to suspect you've taken a fancy to this infidel. But if you prefer
her to the other, then so be it. We offered you whatever you wished. She's
yours. But never let her be seen on the streets of Agra again. We will have her
cut down.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;As please Your Majesty.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It's done.&quot; Arangbar turned to Nadir Sharif.
&quot;Is it true you've found a house for the Inglish?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I have, Your Majesty.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then send her there.&quot; He turned to Hawksworth.
&quot;Allah protect you from these infidel Hindus, Inglish. They have none of
your Inglish honor.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I humbly thank Your Majesty.&quot; Jesus Christ, I've
just been imprisoned in a house staffed by Nadir Sharifs hand-picked spies.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Enough. We've been told to retire early tonight. Her
Majesty thinks we drink to excess.&quot; He laughed a slurred chortle.
&quot;But we will see you tomorrow, Inglish. To talk more. We have much to
discuss. We want to hear what gifts your king is preparing for us. We would
very much like a large mastiff from Europe. We hear they hunt game like a <i>chitah.</i>&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Arangbar drew himself up shakily and two eunuchs
immediately were at his side, helping him from the white marble throne. None of
the guests moved until he had passed through the curtains. Immediately the
eunuchs began moving about the room, extinguishing the lamps. By the time the
guests assembled to leave, the room was virtually dark. Kamala and the
musicians had been escorted from the room by Arangbar's guards. Suddenly
Hawksworth felt Nadir Sharifs hand on his arm.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That was a noble thing you did, Ambassador. We all owe
you a debt of thanks. I have rarely seen His Majesty so out of temper. The
repercussions could have been distressing for many of us.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It was your idea.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Merely a quick fancy, an act of desperation. But
without your cooperation it would have been impossible. I do thank you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;There's nothing to thank me for.&quot; Hawksworth drew
his arm away. &quot;Where's this house you've found for me?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Nadir Sharif sighed. &quot;Finding a secure lodging these
days is more difficult than you might first imagine, Ambassador. But you were
in luck. I remembered there's a small lodge in my palace grounds that is
unoccupied. I did not reckon on quarters for two, but of course the woman will
be living with your servants. The house should serve until something more
fitting can be found.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;My thanks.&quot; Damn you. &quot;When do I move
there?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Your effects have already been moved, on His Majesty's
authority. You can come tonight. My men will show you there. Your dinner is
probably waiting.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>At that moment the last lamp was extinguished. Along with the
other guests they groped their way out of the <i>Diwan-i-Khas </i>in total

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>      
&quot;Many years ago I was a <i>devadasi</i>.&quot; Kamala sat, pillowless, on
the carpet, watching as Hawksworth ate. Her musicians, the flautist and the
drummer, knelt silently behind her. Nadir Sharif’s servants stood by, nervously
attentive, pretending to ignore everyone but Hawksworth. The white plaster
walls of the lamp-lit room fairly flashed with Kamala's diamonds. &quot;Do you
know what that is?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth shook his head, his mouth gorged with roast lamb.
The room was filled with its aroma. It was his first lamb since Burhanpur, and
he was ravenous.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Does that mean yes?&quot; Kamala's Turki was
surprisingly good.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth suddenly remembered the curious Indian</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>convention
of swinging the head from side to side to signify concurrence. He had meant to
say no, which in Indian body language was an almost un-reproducible twist of
the neck. He swallowed the lamb and reached for another shank.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;No. I meant no. Is that a kind of dancer?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It means 'a servant of the gods.' In South India
there's a special caste of women who serve in the great stone temples, who are
married to the god of the temple. When we are very young we have a marriage ceremony,
like any wedding. Except we are a bride of the temple. And then we serve its
god with music and with our dance.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth examined her quizzically. &quot;You mean you were
like a nun?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What is that?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;They're something like Papist priests. Women who give
themselves to God, or at least to the pope's Church.&quot; Hawksworth paused
awkwardly. &quot;And claim to be married to Christ, so they never lie with a
man.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Kamala looked at him with surprise.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Not even the high-caste men who come to the temple? But
how, then, do they serve this Christian God? By dance only?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Nuns aren't known to do much dancing. They mainly . . .
well, I don't really know what they do, except claim to be virgins.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Virgins!&quot; Kamala exploded in laughter. &quot;This
Christian God must be a eunuch. We <i>devadasis </i>serve the temple with our
bodies, not with empty words.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then what exactly did you do?&quot; Hawksworth looked
up and examined her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I was at the famous Shiva temple of Brihadishwari in
Tanjore, the great fountainhead of Bharata Natyam dance in India. There we
danced for the god of the temple, and we danced too at the courts of the
Dravidian kings of the south.&quot; She hesitated, then continued.
&quot;Devadasis there also honor the temple god by lying with men of high caste
who come to worship, and by wearing the jewels they give us. It's all part of
our sacred tradition.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She laughed as she watched the disbelief flood Hawks-</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>worth's
face. &quot;I gather we must be quite different from your Christian 'nuns.' But
you know <i>devadasis </i>are honored in the south. Many are granted lands by
the men they know, and though they can never marry, <i>devadasis </i>sometimes
become attached to a man and bear his children. But our children always take
our name and are dedicated to the temple. Our daughters become <i>devadasis </i>also,
and our sons temple musicians. Our dance gurus are part of a hereditary guild,
and they are esteemed above all men. They are the ones who preserve and pass
down the sacred Bharata Natyam dance. You may not believe me when I tell you we
are highly revered by the kings who reign in the south, lands where the Moghuls
fear to tread. They know we are special among women. We are cultivated artists,
and among the few Hindu women in India who teach our daughters to read and
write.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'll believe you.&quot; Hawksworth studied her, not
quite sure it was true. &quot;But if you're dedicated to a temple in the south,
why are you here in Agra?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Kamala's dark eyes grew lifeless, and then she turned away.
&quot;I'm no longer a true <i>devadasi</i>. In truth, I have not danced at my
temple for many years. The first time the Moghul’s army invaded the south, a
Rajput officer who had deserted came to our temple to hide. He fell in love
with me and forced me to come with him when he returned to Agra, telling me I
must dance for him only.&quot; Her voice hardened. &quot;But I never danced for
him, not once. And three years later he was killed in a campaign in Bengal.
Since that time I have had to live by my own hand. For many years now I've
lived by teaching dance to the <i>tavaifs </i>in Agra.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Who?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;<i>Tavaifs</i>. Muslim dancing girls. Courtesans who
live in beautiful houses here and entertain men. There are many in Agra and in
the city of Lucknow to the east.&quot; Kamala's tone grew vague. &quot;And I
teach them other things as well.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But why did you insult the Moghul tonight? Do you
really believe all the things you said?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What I said was not a 'belief.' I don't understand what
you mean by that. Things either are or they are not. What does it matter
whether we 'believe' them? But what I did was foolish, I agree. Impulsive. I so
despise the Moghuls. You know, I told the Moghul’s prime minister this
afternoon I would never dance for Arangbar, that nothing could make me, but he
forced me to come anyway.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth's eyes narrowed, and he dropped the shank of lamb
he was holding. &quot;What did you say! Nadir Sharif knew all along you would
refuse to dance for Arangbar?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Of course he knew. And I knew Arangbar would order me
killed. That's why I wore all my diamonds. I thought if I was to die, it must
be my dharma.&quot;' She paused. &quot;And you know, it's strange but I felt
nothing. Except perhaps pity for my pretty little courtesans. Some of them are
only girls, and I wondered who would teach them after I was gone.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth was no longer listening. He was trying to remember
the exact sequence of what had happened in the <i>Diwan-i-Khas</i>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>He arranged it, the bastard. Even the paintings.
Nadir Sharif played with me like a puppet. Just so he could send her here. He
knew I'd try to save her. But why would he do it, and in such a way I was never
supposed to know? Is this so--called dancer supposed to be another of his
spies?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You said you worshipped a god named Shiva. I thought
Hindus worshiped Krishna.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Kamala looked at him with surprise. &quot;You know of
Krishna? Yes, he is the god worshiped by the Rajputs of the north. But he is a
young god. Lord Shiva is the ancient god of south India. He presides over the
generation of life. His lingam symbolizes the male half of the force that
created the universe.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And I suppose you're about to tell me that's the part
of him you worship.&quot; Hawksworth kept a straight face.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;He is revered in many aspects, including Nataraj, the
God of the Dance. But yes, his lingam is worshiped. Have you seen the round
stone pillars wreathed in garlands of flowers?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;As a matter of fact . . .&quot; Hawksworth paused, then
looked at her sharply. &quot;There was something of that sort in the porters'
lodge of the customs house at Surat, where my men and I were kept the morning
we arrived.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Those pillars symbolize Shiva's lingam. Let me tell you
about it. Once, back in the time of the gods, Lord Shiva was burdened with
unhappiness. He was bereaved of his consort and weary with his being. And he
wandered into a forest, where there were sages and their wives. But the sages
scorned Lord Shiva, because he was haggard, and they forsook him in his time of
sadness. So he had to make his way through the forest begging alms. However,
the women of these sages felt love for him, and they left the beds of their men
and followed him. When the sages saw their wives leaving to follow Shiva, they
set a curse on him. Their curse was that his lingam would fall to the ground.
Then one day Shiva did shed his lingam. And he was gone. Only his lingam
remained, emerging upright from the earth. It had become stone, and it was of infinite
length. All the other gods came to worship it, and told mankind to do likewise.
They said that if it was worshiped, Shiva's consort, the goddess Parvati, would
come to receive the lingam in her <i>yoni</i>, and the earth would be made
fertile. And even now we worship the stone lingam, set erect with a stone <i>yoni
</i>as its base. We honor them with flowers and fire and incense. Shiva and
Parvati are a symbol of the creation of life.&quot; She looked at him,
puzzling. &quot;Don't Christians have such a symbol?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Not quite like that one.&quot; Hawksworth suppressed a
grin. &quot;I guess the main symbol for Christians is the cross.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What do you mean?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Christians believe the Son of the Christian God came
down to earth and sacrificed Himself on a cross. So the cross became a symbol
for that act.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Yes, I've seen that symbol. Jesuits wear them, covered
with jewels. But I never knew its meaning.&quot; Kamala paused, seeming to
ponder the idea. &quot;Somehow though it seems very static. Surely there are
other symbols the Christians have, symbols more dynamic and powerful.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I suppose Christians think it's pretty powerful.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But don't Christians have any symbols like our bronze
statues of the Dancing Shiva? Lord Shiva, in his aspect as Nataraj, the God of
the Dance, embodies everything in the world.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That's what you said to Arangbar.&quot; Hawksworth
examined her and tried to clear his mind of the wine. &quot;But I don't
understand why you think symbols are so important, whatever their
meaning.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Symbols are a visible sign of things we know but can't
actually see, like an idea.&quot; Kamala's voice was soft and warm.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;All right. But it's hard to imagine how one symbol
could contain everything, no matter what it is.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But the Dancing Shiva does, my handsome <i>feringhi</i>.
Perhaps you have not seen it. It came out of the great civilization of the
south. Let me explain it for you, and then perhaps you will understand why
dance is the deepest form of worship.&quot; Kamala rose, bells tinkling, and
assumed a dance posture, arms outstretched, one foot raised across the other.
Nadir Sharifs Muslim servants paused to stare in amazement. &quot;The bronze
statues of Dancing Shiva have four arms, so you will have to imagine the other
two. One leg is crossed over the other and raised, as you see now. And the
figure stands inside a great circle of bronze.&quot; She made a momentary sweep
around her body with her hands. &quot;On this circle are flame tips everywhere
pointing outward. The circle signifies the world as we know it, the world of
time and of things, and the flame tips are the limitless energy of the
universe. Lord Shiva dances within this great circle, because he is everywhere.
In fact, the universe itself was created through his dance. And our world here
is merely his <i>lila</i>, his sport&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You mean he created both good and bad? Christians
believe there's evil only because woman tempted man into sin somewhere along
the way.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Sin? What do you mean by that?&quot; Kamala stared at
him blankly for a moment. &quot;Whatever it is, Shiva created it. His dance
created everything in nature.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What does he look like, besides having four arms?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;First, he has long hair, which represents the hair of
the yogi, the contemplative one, and this long hair streams out from his head,
to the very ends of the universe, since he has all knowledge. And each of his
four arms has a different meaning. In this one, the upper right arm, he holds a
small drum, signifying sound, music and words, the first thing that appeared in
the universe. And in his left hand he holds a burning fire, his symbol of
destruction. He creates and he also destroys. His lower right hand is held up
in a sign.&quot; She held up her hand, palm out as though in a blessing.
&quot;This is a <i>mudra</i>, part of the hand language we use in the dance,
and it means 'fear not'; it is his benediction of peace. The fourth hand points
down toward his feet. One foot is crushing a repugnant, powerful dwarf, who
represents man's willfulness, and the other is held up against the forces of
the earth, signifying man's spiritual freedom.&quot; Kamala paused and looked
at Hawksworth hopefully. &quot;Do you understand? Do you see how the Dancing
Shiva symbolizes everything—space, time, creation, destruction? And also
hope.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth scratched his head in silent confoundment. Kamala
watched him, then sighed and resumed her seat on the floor.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then just try to feel what I am saying. Words really
cannot express these ideas as well as dance. When we dance we invoke the
energy, and the life force, that moves through the world, outside its great
cycles of time.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth picked up his wineglass and drew on it. &quot;To tell
the truth, I find your Hindu symbols a trifle abstract.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But they're not, really. They merely embody truths
already within us. Like the life force. We do not have to think about it. It's
simply there. And we can reach out and experience this force when woman and man
join together in union. That is our <i>lila</i>, our play. That's why we
worship Lord Shiva with dance, and with <i>kama</i>.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As Hawksworth watched, sipping his wine and scarcely
understanding her words, he realized he had begun to desire this bizarre woman
intensely.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You haven't told me what <i>kama </i>is.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That's because I'm not sure you can understand.&quot;
She scrutinized him professionally. &quot;How old are you?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm closer to forty than thirty.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Time, I think, has treated you harshly. Or is it the
spirits you drink?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What's wrong with a bit of grog now and then?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I think you should not drink so much. I drink nothing.
Look at me.&quot; She pushed back the hair from both sides of her forehead. Her
face was flawless. &quot;You know most Muslims despise their women after
thirty, usually before, but many young officers still ask to visit me. Can you
guess how old I am?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;A woman only asks that if she thinks she looks younger
than she is.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm over fifty.&quot; She examined him directly,
invitingly. &quot;How much over you must only speculate.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I don't want to. I'm still trying to figure out what
exactly happened tonight.&quot; He studied her. &quot;But whatever it was, I'm
not sure I care anymore.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth shoved aside his plates of lamb and rice pilaf and
watched as the servants began hastily clearing the carpet.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>In the quiet that followed he reached behind him to his
chest, opened the latch, and took out his lute. Kamala watched with curiosity.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What instrument is that?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Someone in Surat once called it an English sitar.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Kamala laughed. &quot;It's far too plain for that. But it
does have a simple beauty. Will you play it for me?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;For you, and for me.&quot; Hawksworth strummed a chord.
The white plaster walls echoed back the wave of notes, a choir of thin voices.
&quot;It brings back my sea legs when I'm ashore.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;Now I do not understand you. But I will
listen.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He began a short, plaintive galliard. Suddenly his heart was
in London, with honest English faces, clear English air. And he felt an
overwhelming ache of separation. He played through to the end, then wistfully
laid the lute aside. After a moment Kamala reached for his wineglass and held
it for him, waiting.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The music of your English sitar is simple, young
Ambassador. Like the instrument itself. But I think it moves you. Perhaps I
felt something of your loneliness in the notes.&quot; She paused and studied
him quietly. &quot;But you yourself are not simple. Nothing about you comes
easily. I sense you are filled with something you cannot express.&quot; She
looked at him a moment longer, and then her voice came again, soft as the wine.
&quot;Why did you say what you did to Arangbar tonight? I was nothing to you.
You violated my <i>dharma</i>. Perhaps it is true, as many tell me, that I have
mastered the arts of <i>kama </i>more fully than any woman in Agra, but still
there is less and less pleasure in my life. What will you do now? Perhaps you
think I belong to you, like some courtesan you have bought. But you are wrong.
I belong to no man.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You're here because someone wanted you here.&quot;
Hawksworth glanced around them. The room was empty now save for Kamala's two
musicians. &quot;I don't know why, but I do know you're the first person I've
met in a long time who was not afraid of Arangbar. The last one was a woman in
Surat.&quot; Hawksworth paused suddenly. &quot;I'm starting to wonder if you
know her.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I don't know anyone in Surat.&quot; She swept him with
her eyes. &quot;But what does some woman in Surat have to do with me?'</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Perhaps someone thought I should meet you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Who? Someone in Surat? But why?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Perhaps she thought I needed . . . I don't know exactly.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then tell me what you mean by 'need'? That's an odd
phrase, a <i>feringhi </i>expression. Perhaps you mean our meeting is part of
your <i>dharma</i>?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You mean like it's a Rajput's <i>dharma </i>to be a
warrior and kill?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;<i>Dharma</i> can be many things. It's what each of us
must do, our purpose.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That's something I've heard before.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But do you know what your <i>dharma</i> is?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm still trying to find it. Maybe it's to be here . .
.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And then what?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;I'm . . . I guess I'm still working out the
rest.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, for Hindus there's a second aim in life besides
our honoring our dharma. We call it <i>artha</i>. That aim is to have things.
Knowledge, wealth, friends. Is that part of why you're here?&quot; Kamala
smiled scornfully. &quot;Some merchants seem to believe <i>artha </i>is their
primary aim.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It can't be for me. I somehow always manage to lose
whatever I have.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Hindus also believe there's a third aim in life, my
handsome <i>feringhi</i>. And that's <i>kama</i>. It's to take pleasure in the
senses.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I think I like the sound of that better than the other
two.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Do not speak of it lightly. For Hindus it is just as
essential as the other two aims. <i>Kama </i>is taught by Lord Shiva and his
consort Parvati. It means love, pleasure, the primal force of desire.&quot; She
stared at Hawksworth for a long moment, and then at the lute standing in the
corner. &quot;Music is part of <i>kama</i>. It's one way we experience beauty
and pleasure. That's the <i>kama </i>of the heart. But there's also <i>kama </i>of
the body, and I do not think you yet know it. Your music betrays you. You are a
man of sensuality.&quot; Kamala looked at him regretfully. &quot;But not of the
sensuous. Do you even understand the difference?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;How do you know what I am?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Remember I was once a <i>devadasi</i>. It's my <i>dharma
</i>to know the hearts of men. Who they are and what gives them pleasure.&quot;
She fell silent for a moment, then continued. &quot;The sensualist is one who
only knows his own feelings; the one who is sensuous knows also how to
give.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth shifted uncomfortably, uncertain how to reply.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Do you, Ambassador <i>Feringhi</i>, touch a woman with
the same feeling you touch the strings of your English sitar?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I don't see any connection.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The arts of <i>kama </i>are not unlike the mastery of
your sitar. You can spend a lifetime learning to sound its notes, but you do
not create music unless your hand is in touch with your heart, with <i>prahna</i>,
the breath of life. It's the same with <i>kama</i>.&quot; She paused
discreetly. &quot;Have you ever known it with a woman in India?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well . . . I knew a courtesan in Surat who . . .&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Kamala's eyes hardened, but her voice remained dulcet.
&quot;Is this the woman you spoke of?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;No, this was a different woman. Her name was Kali and
she was thrown out of Arangbar's <i>zenana</i>.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Ah, she was probably badly trained. But still. Did you
feel the force of <i>kama</i> with this Surat courtesan?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth shifted again, uneasily. &quot;That's not the type
of thing we normally talk about in England.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Don't be foolish. You judge the skill of a musician.
Why not of a courtesan?&quot; She turned and said something Hawksworth did not
understand. Both musicians immediately rose and moved a screen across the
corner of the room where they were sitting. Then, from behind the screen came
the first notes of a simple, poignant melody, the soft tones of the bamboo
swelling slowly to envelop the room in their gentleness. &quot;I have asked him
to play the <i>alap</i>, the opening section, of a south Indian raga for you.
To help you understand. His music has the life breath of <i>prahna</i>. He
speaks to Lord Shiva with his music. <i>Kama</i> too must come from the heart.
If we are worthy, we evoke the life-giving power within us.&quot; Her eyes
snapped back to Hawksworth. &quot;But tell me more about this Surat
courtesan.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;Perhaps I'm not entirely qualified to judge.
She certainly knew more tricks than most women in England.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That's not surprising. It's well known <i>feringhi </i>women
know nothing of pleasure.&quot; Kamala paused and studied Hawksworth carefully
with her dark eyes. &quot;But I've never known a <i>feringhi </i>who could move
my senses with music. You did that just now, even though I don't understand
how. I cannot dance for you; that is for Shiva. But I want to touch you.&quot;
She shifted on the carpet until she was at Hawksworth's feet. With a gentle
motion she removed a boot and quickly ran a finger across one toe. Nerves
throughout his body tingled unexpectedly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What did you do just then?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The secret of <i>kama </i>is touch. To touch and be
touched by one we desire always gives pleasure. Do you understand what I
mean?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Is that <i>kama</i>?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;A very small part.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You know, the courtesan in Surat actually told me about
you. She said you had a book . . . an ancient text.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Kamala laughed and began to remove the other boot. &quot;And
I've always heard that <i>feringhi </i>think everything can be put in books.
You probably mean the <i>Kama Sutra</i>. Whoever told you about it has probably
never seen it. Of course I have it, and I can tell you it is one of the great
frauds of India. It was compiled by a musty scholar named Vatsyayana, who
obviously knew nothing about giving pleasure, and simply copied things here and
there from much older books. It's amusing, perhaps, but it's also pedantic and
ignorant. It's certainly not sensuous, and the reason is he knew nothing about
desire. He probably had none. He only knew how to make lists of things, like
ways of biting and scratching during love play, but he had no idea why these
are exciting.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She stroked the other foot very lightly along the arch with
her long red fingernail, and again a bolt of sensation shot through him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm beginning to see your point.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I don't think you understand anything yet. Did you know
the pleasure, the power, the beauty possible in your music on the very first
day you touched a string of this instrument?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I knew there was something in music that moved me, but
I wasn't sure what it was.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;And now, many years later, you know.&quot; She
shifted next to him and began unfastening the bells on her ankles. They chimed
gently as she carefully laid them aside. Then she opened a small silver box she
had brought and placed a red dot in the middle of her forehead, just below the
pendant jewel.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I sense the first stirrings of <i>kama </i>inside me
now. The awakening of desire. And because I feel it, I know you must feel it
too.&quot; She loosened his doublet and pushed him gently against the bolster.
The notes of the flute wound through the dark air around them. Kamala listened
a moment in silence, then slowly rose off the bolster.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She stood before him, holding his gaze with her eyes, and
pulled away the heavy, jeweled belt at the waist of her dance sari. She dropped
it at his feet, never averting her eyes. Then she made a half turn and twisted
her hip gracefully into a voluptuous bulge. The silk clung even tighter to the
statuesque curve of her legs as she crossed her feet with an almost ceremonial
deliberation. Wordlessly she slowly drew the silk end of the <i>sari </i>from
across her shoulder and let it drop before her, revealing the curve of a
perfectly spherical breast. Seen from behind her body was fixed in a perfect
double curve, a sensuous &quot;S&quot; whose top was the full line of her
half-revealed breast and whose bottom was the rounded edge of her hip.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>In those few simple motions she had transmuted her body, as
though through some deep cultural memory, into an ancient fertility totem, a
prayer for the bounty of the human loins. It was, Hawksworth suddenly realized,
a pose identical to that of a statue he'd seen in a mossy temple in Mandu, on
the way north from Burhanpur. It was the essence of the female principle,
sharing with the earth itself the power of life. That stone goddess had
automatically stirred his desire, as it had the desire of man thousands of
years before, as it was meant to do. Now it stood before him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Before he could move, she turned again and swept up the
pleats of silk that comprised the front of her <i>sari</i>. She whipped the
loose ends of silk about her head once, twice, and magically it seemed to
evaporate from her body. All that remained was a small drape of silk about her
waist, held in place by a thin band of jade.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Her body was like ivory, perfect from the band at her neck to
the small rings on her toes, and her breasts billowed full and geometrically
round, a long necklace of pearls nestled between them. As Hawksworth stared at
her dumbfounded, the drummer commenced a finely metered rhythm timed exactly
with his heartbeat.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She moved to Hawksworth's side and slid her left hand beneath
his open doublet. &quot;The very first note of a raga can contain everything if
it is sounded with <i>prahna</i>. And the first touch between a man and a woman
can become the OM, the syllable that carries the totality of creation.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Her hand glided over his body with the gentleness of a
feather, and in moments his ambassador's ensemble slipped away like some
superfluous ancient skin. He looked at her again, still overwhelmed by her
physical perfection, and reached to touch the curve of her breast.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Her hand stopped his in midair.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Shiva, in his dance, had four hands. But he did not use
them for touch. Do you want to feel the touch of my breasts? Then feel them
with your body.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She guided him over, across the round bolster, then rose
above him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Your body is hard and firm, like the stone lingam of
Shiva. But your skin still has a hidden softness, like a covering of raw
silk.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He felt the hard touch of her nipple as it began to trace the
crease of his back. It moved slowly, tantalizingly, trailing just at the skin.
Now the musk of her perfume had begun to hover about his head, fogging his mind
even more. But the sensation of her touch, and the knowledge it was the breast
he wanted exquisitely to hold, attuned his starved senses to everything around
him, even the quiet rhythm of her breath.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Suddenly, without warning, she slid the tip of her long red
fingernail sharply down the same crease in his back, where his nerves strained
for sensation. He felt a delicious burst of pain, and whirled to meet her
smiling eyes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What . . .?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Do you see now how your sense of touch can be awakened?
Now you may touch my breasts, but only with the nails of your fingers.
Here.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She drew him to his feet and twined one leg about his body,
her heel in the small of his back, enveloping him with her warmth as though it
were a cloak. Then she embraced him with her thighs and took his hands in her
own, forcing a pattern of scratches on each of her breasts with his nails. Each
was different, and each time she pressed his hand, she named the shape of, the
mark. Her breathing grew increasingly rapid from the pain, and soon both her
breasts were decorated with a garland of hard red lines.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>At last Hawksworth tried to speak, but she seized his lower
lip between her teeth while her nails quickly imprinted a pattern of identical
scratches across his own chest. He found the pain oddly exhilarating. It seemed
to flow between their bodies, attuning them deeply one to the other.
Instinctively he moved to take her, but she twined herself even tighter about
him, unattainable. Then, when he thought he could endure it no longer, she
lowered herself easily against the bolster.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He scarcely noticed as the pace of the drum intensified.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Remember, you cannot touch with your hands. Anything
else is allowed.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The wine had saturated his mind, but now he found the
pleasure of desiring of her body overwhelming. He moved across her lightly with
the tip of his tongue, first tasting her lips, then her dark nipples, then the
ivory-smooth arch beneath her arms. There her skin was soft as a child's and so
sensitive he caused her to shudder involuntarily. He teased her slowly,
languorously, until she erupted with cries of pleasure. Then he moved his
tongue slowly down her body, trailing the circle of the navel lightly to find
the few light wisps of down she had failed to banish. These he teased lightly
with his breath until he sensed she could endure it no longer. Then he traced
his sex along the inside of her thighs, upward to the fringe of her silk wrap,
until at last they were both lost in desire.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>With a quick motion she rose and drew astride his body, still
scarcely touching him. The silk at her waist came away in her hands and without
a sound she twined it into a moist rope. Kneeling above him now she drew it
slowly across the tips of her own nipples, then across his. Then she pulled the
binding of jewels from her hair and with a toss of her head spread the dark
strands across his chest. As he watched, she seized the ends of her hair and
began to draw them slowly, expertly, against the sensitive underside of the
phallus that stood beneath her. Her breath came in short bursts as she drew
close enough to tease her own sex as well.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He knew he had lost when he felt his last attempts at
restraint dissolve. Then her breath told him she had lost as well. With their
eyes joined, each exquisitely aware of the other's imminent resolution, she
quickly slipped her left hand beneath her and caught the uppermost tip of the
phallus with her nails, holding it taut, the pain intensifying his pleasure.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She had directed the pulse at the point of her own ecstasy,
guiding the warm seed exactly as she wanted, against her own hard bud. As it
struck her, she gave the <i>sitkrita </i>cry of release and with a hard shudder
fell across him, loin against loin, exquisitely replete.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As the drummer pounded the final <i>sum </i>of the raga,
Hawksworth realized she used his resolution to bring her own. Without their
bodies touching.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The room lay silent about them, as though enfolded in their
content. Only their hard breath remained.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I never knew lovemaking could be so intense.&quot; He
startled himself by his own admission.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Because I loved you with more than just with my
body.&quot; She smiled at him carefully and reached out to touch the marks on
his chest. &quot;But that was merely the first stage of <i>kama</i>. Are you
ready now for the second?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>       
Nadir Sharif studied the pigeon as it glided onto the red sandstone ledge and
rustled its feathers in exhausted satisfaction. It cocked its white-spotted
head for a moment as it examined the prime minister, then waddled contentedly
toward the water cup waiting just inside the carved stone pigeon house.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He immediately recognized it as one of the birds he kept
stationed in Gwalior, his last pigeon stage en route to Agra from the south.
The cylinder bound to its leg, however, was not one of his own. Imprinted on
its silver cap was the seal of the new Portuguese Viceroy of Goa, Miguel
Vaijantes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Nadir Sharif waited patiently for the pigeon to drink. He
knew well the rewards of patience. He had waited patiently, studying the <i>feringhi</i>,
for a full week. And he had learned almost all he needed to know.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The Englishman had been invited to durbar every day since his
arrival. Arangbar was diverted by his stories and bemused by his rustic gifts.
(The only gift that had not entertained Arangbar was the book of maps he had
wheedled out of the Englishman, which upon inspection showed India as something
far less than the greatest continent on the globe. But Arangbar found the map's
rendering of India's coastline to be sufficiently naive to cast the accuracy of
the entire book into question.) This was the first <i>feringhi </i>Arangbar had
ever met who could speak Turkish and understand his native Turki, and the
Moghul rejoiced in being able to snub the Jesuits and dispense with their
services as translators.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But most of all, Arangbar loved to challenge the Englishman
to drinking bouts, as night after night they matched cups in the <i>Diwan-i-Khas
</i>until near midnight. As Arangbar and the Englishman drew closer, the
Jesuits had grown distraught to near madness. The hard-drinking Englishman
bragged of the East India Company and its bold plans for trade, of the old
Levant Company and its disputes with Spain over Mediterranean routes, of
English privateering in the West Indies. Of everything . . . except when the
next voyage would come.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Nadir Sharif had listened closely to their expansive talk all
those nights, and he had finally deciphered to his own satisfaction the answer
to the question uppermost in Arangbar's mind.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The Englishman is bluffing. England has no fleet. At least no
fleet that can ever hope to threaten Portuguese control of the Indian Ocean.
There'll be no more voyages, and no more presents, for at least a year. The
Englishman is living a fool's dream.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>When his European presents are gone, and he's spent what's
left of his money buying jewels and gifts for the Moghul, he'll be dropped from
court. Arangbar plays him like a puppet, always hinting the <i>firman </i>will
be ready tomorrow. But there'll be no <i>firman </i>unless Arangbar can be
convinced the English king is powerful enough to protect Indian shipping from
Portuguese reprisals at sea. And this the English clearly cannot do. At least
not now, not without a fleet. The Englishman is living on borrowed time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>And I'm beginning to think he suspects it himself. He drinks
more than a man in his place should. He's always able to stay in control, but
just barely. If Arangbar were not always drunk himself, he would have noticed
it also.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Nadir Sharif glanced at the silver cylinder and smiled to
himself. So His Excellency, Miguel Vaijantes, is worried. Undoubtedly he's
demanding I contain the Englishman, isolate him from Arangbar.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It will hardly be necessary. The Englishman is destined to be
forgotten soon. How much longer can he hold the Moghul’s attention? A month?
Two months? I know his supply of trifles for Arangbar is already half depleted.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But why burden the Viceroy with this insight? Bargain with
him. Let him pay enough and I will guarantee with my life that the sun will
rise tomorrow morning. The end of the Englishman is no less sure.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Nadir Sharif stroked the pigeon lovingly as he began to
unwind the silk binding holding the cylinder, and it reminded him again of the
Deccan.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Still no pigeons from Mumtaz. How curious that her one
dispatch in the last month, the one brought by the Rajput, was merely to
request that small accommodation for the Englishman. Who knows why she asked
it? Perhaps it was a joke of the prince's.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Nadir Sharif congratulated himself on how easy it had been.
The Englishman had never known.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>And it was obvious the woman Kamala <i>had </i>changed him,
smoothed him. Was the prince grooming him for something? If so, why send the
request through Mumtaz? Whatever the reason, it had been a pleasure to grant
this one favor for the daughter he doted on. He also realized it might well be
the last favor he could ever do for her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It was clear now that Prince Jadar would be banished from
Agra forever. The events of the next four weeks were inexorable.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Today Arangbar's birthday celebrations begin. Next week
Allaudin will be guest of honor at a <i>shikar</i>, a royal hunt. Two weeks
after that, the wedding formalities begin, and the following week is the
wedding itself. Four weeks and Jadar will be finished. Even if he returned to
Agra today, he could not forestall the inevitable.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Nadir Sharif took the pigeon on his wrist and offered it a
few grains of soaked <i>dal</i> from his own hand as he gently slipped off the
silver cylinder. When the bird was pecking contentedly he eased it onto the
ledge, twisted away the silver cap of the cylinder, and settled against the
rooftop divan to translate the cipher.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The morning wind from the Jamuna grew suddenly chill against
his skin. Then, as the message slowly emerged, the wind from the Jamuna became
ice.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Nadir Sharif translated the cipher again, to be sure. But
there could be no mistaking what it said. Or what it meant. He would have
declared its contents an absurd hoax, perhaps even a hoax inspired by the
Englishman, had not the message been intercepted by the Portuguese, by capture
of one of Jadar's own pigeons.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The cipher did not say so, but doubtless a copy had also been
sent to Arangbar. Even had it not, the Moghul still would hear the news within
the day. His own intelligence network was the best in India, after that of the
queen.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He closed the door of the pigeon house, picked up a small
silver bell beside the divan, and rang lightly. Almost before he had replaced
the bell, a eunuch was waiting.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Your pleasure, Sharif Sahib.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The Englishman. Where is he now?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;In the garden, Sharif Sahib. He's always there at this
time of day, with the Hindu woman.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What's he doing there?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Who can say, Sharif Sahib? All we know is he goes into
the garden every day around noon—I think the Hindu woman may be teaching him to
play the sitar there—before going to <i>durbar </i>in the Red Fort. But he will
be leaving soon now, as you must, to be present for His Majesty's birthday
weighings.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The English <i>feringhi </i>was invited?&quot; Nadir
Sharif was momentarily startled.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;He received an invitation, Sharif Sahib.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Bring him to the reception room. I will see him now,
before he leaves.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The eunuch snapped around and was gone. Nadir Sharif paused
to translate the cipher one last time before ringing for his turban.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Ambassador Hawksworth, please forgive my preoccupation
these past few days.&quot; Nadir Sharif was bowing, it seemed, unusually low.
&quot;We're not always privileged to entertain our guests as we might wish.
Preparations for today's birthday ceremonies have kept me rushing about the
palace. But please, be seated.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth's gaze swept the room. It was cavernous, hung with
thick tapestries on every wall, and lightly perfumed with rose incense. Before
he could reply a bowing servant was proffering a chalice of Persian wine. As
Nadir Sharif watched a glass being poured, his voice continued, silken.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Have you found anything here to pass the time? They
tell me you've developed an interest in the sitar. A marvelous instrument
really. And in my garden. Tell me, what do you think of it?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I can't decide.&quot; Hawksworth felt his caution
rising automatically, as it did any time he found himself alone with Nadir
Sharif. &quot;It reminds me of some of the Tudor gardens connected with English
castles, but still it's different. I like the precise geometry of the walkways
and hedges, and the running water. It's a soothing place to sit and
practice.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;So you find the Persian garden soothing? It is Persian,
you know. The whole idea of a symmetrical garden comes from Persia. Not from
this barbarous wasteland.&quot; Nadir Sharif motioned him to a bolster, and
paused until he was seated. &quot;Yes, it's soothing. I agree with you. But of
course, that's one of the purposes of a garden.&quot; Nadir Sharif eased himself
against a bolster and accepted a glass of <i>sharbat</i>. &quot;It pleases me
that you enjoy my garden. You see, Ambassador, to a man in the desert, an
oasis, a spot of water and green, is like a paradise. So we sometimes believe
we are creating a bit of Allah's Paradise when we create a garden. You know,
the Holy Quran itself tells us that Paradise will be something like a
garden.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But whose idea was it to build Persian gardens
here?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;When the first Moghul conqueror arrived in India,
almost a century ago, he declared the land here around Agra to be particularly
barren and depressing. So he immediately built a Persian garden. But we must
all do our share, so today there are many gardens, all over India. The garden,
you see, is our tribute to nature.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But why so geometrical? Your garden uses water, stones,
and plants to create designs that seem almost like the marble floors of your
palace.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Mathematics, Ambassador, principles of law. Islam is
the rule of law. Why do you think we have so many mathematicians? I
deliberately designed this garden with calculated geometric divisions. It
provides me great satisfaction to impose order on the willfulness of
nature.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But why are the stone pathways all elevated above the
level of the garden? In English gardens they're at ground level and lined with
shrubs.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But surely that's obvious as well. Our gardens are
really concealed waterways, with water constantly flowing from one end to the
other. We must put the walkways above the water.&quot; Nadir Sharif waved his
hand. &quot;But all of that is merely mechanics. The garden is where we find
peace. It's where we wait to greet the spring, whose arrival we celebrate at
the Persian New Year.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Nadir Sharif strolled to a window and looked out on the
garden. &quot;Spring in India seems to come up from the south. It's said that
buds appear each day a few <i>kos </i>farther north, like a tender army on the
march. But we Persians believe that spring must have a haven if she is to stay.
And that's another reason we build gardens.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I don't understand.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;There's a famous poem in Persian, by the poet Farrukhi,
about gardens and spring. He once wrote of a place where spring always arrived
feeling lowly and despised, because there was no land for her save desert, a
place of rocks and thistles. But then a rich man—actually the patron of
Farrukhi, whom he was writing to flatter—built a garden for her and the next
year spring came forth from the south and found a home there.&quot; Nadir
Sharif smiled. &quot;In fact the poem begins by comparing spring's original
arrivals to that of a bankrupt <i>feringhi's</i>, who appeared with no carpet,
no livelihood. But after spring discovered the garden, she brought from the
south turquoise for the willows, rubies for the rose.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Nadir Sharif smiled. &quot;What do you think of Farrukhi's
poem, Ambassador?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What do you mean?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Curiosity. I was wondering what are the chances that
spring will come again from the south this year? Did the 'bankrupt <i>feringhi</i>
merely come to see if the garden was ready? Was the first arrival of spring
false, with the real arrival yet to come?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth studied Nadir Sharifs face. &quot;I don't
understand what you're trying to say. But I would like to know if you've spoken
to His Majesty about the <i>firman</i>.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;Please believe I mention it daily. I think now
he'll soon agree to terms.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then there's nothing yet?&quot; Hawksworth set down the
glass of wine. &quot;I assumed that was why you wanted to speak to me. But you
just wanted to talk about Persian gardens and Persian poets.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Ambassador, I'm not a man for idle talk. Surely we know
each other better than that.&quot; Nadir Sharif turned and banished the
servants and eunuchs with a wave of his hand.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Tell me. I know you met Prince Jadar once. Give me your
honest opinion. Do you think he's a clever man?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth nodded noncommittally.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I can assure you, Ambassador, that he's very clever
indeed. Even his staunchest detractors would agree on that. And he's also
resourceful. Not many here are aware he has a full intelligence network of his
own. He does not, of course, have access to the dispatches of the official
court reporters in the provinces, the <i>wakianavis</i>, or the dispatches of
His Majesty's confidential reporters, the <i>harkaras</i>.&quot; Nadir Sharif
paused. &quot;At least we do not think he has access to their reports. But in a
way he doesn't really need them. You see, he has his own system of reporters,
which we know he began creating over two years ago. Spies whose identity is
carefully guarded. We do not know any of their names, but we do know he calls
them his <i>swanih-nigars</i>, and they prepare detailed information on
anything in the provinces he asks them to. His network is extensive and, I
understand, quite effective.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth suddenly found himself remembering Shirin, the
papers in the observatory, and wondering . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Naturally he has agents along the southern coast. But
at times they can be a bit too careless about the information they gather. For
example, a cipher intended for the prince— sent by one of Jadar's secret <i>swanih-nigars
</i>stationed in Cochin, on the far southern end of the Malabar Coast—was just
intercepted by a Portuguese shipping agent at the port of Mangalore, down the
coast south of Goa. The message was of great interest to the Portuguese, and
they saw fit to forward it to me. What do you suppose the message
contained?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth pulled himself alert.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I have no idea.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Tell me, Ambassador. The East India Company does trade
on Java, am I correct?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;Six years ago the Company established a
factory . . . a trading station . . . at Bantam, the main port on the
island.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Was there a voyage to Bantam this year?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The <i>Discovery</i> was bound for Bantam this year,
with cargo from Surat.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Ambassador, the time for games is over. Your charade
has made things very difficult for those of us who would try to help you.&quot;
Nadir Sharif studied Hawksworth deliberately, almost sadly. &quot;It would have
been helpful if you had told me everything sooner. It's embarrassing that I
must receive my information through captured intelligence, when I'm authorized
to serve as your agent. I'm sure it will not surprise you that the Portuguese
Viceroy, His Excellency, Miguel Vaijantes, is most disturbed at the news. There
will be consequences.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What are you talking about?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The cipher for Jadar. You could have told me sooner of
your king's plans. It would have made all the difference.&quot; Nadir Sharif
stared coldly at Hawksworth. &quot;There's no longer any need to pretend you
don't know. The fleet was sighted off the Malabar Coast, by coastal fishing
barks, only three days ago. Four armed frigates, showing English colors, with a
course north by northwest, which means they will stand to sea and avoid the
Portuguese patrols along the coast. It was only by the slightest chance that
they were seen. And then another accident that the cipher intended for Jadar
was intercepted. Otherwise no one would have known. It was very resourceful of
your East India Company, Ambassador, to have a second fleet sail up our west
coast from the English factory at Java. Unless the Portuguese had intercepted
and decoded Jadar's cipher, they would have been taken completely by surprise.
Now they estimate the English fleet is scheduled to reach Surat within the
month. Unless they are met and engaged . . . which they most assuredly will
be.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The perfumed air of midmorning still seemed to hover above
the inner courtyard of Arangbar's palace as Hawksworth approached its towering
wooden gates. The astonishing news of the English fleet had sent his spirits
soaring, and he had donned his finest doublet and hose for the occasion. As
scimitared eunuchs scrutinized his gilded invitation and bowed obsequiously for
him to pass, he suddenly felt he was walking through the portals of a Persian
dreamland.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>For the past two months servants and slaves had toiled
through the crisp autumn nights transforming the courtyard of the Red Fort's
inner palace from an open-air marble arcade into a vast, magnificent reception
room for Arangbar's five-day lunar birthday fete. The surrounding galleries had
been softened with rich carpets, their walls cloaked in new tapestries; and in
the central square a flowering garden, freshened by interlocking marble
fountains, had appeared out of nothing. In this new garden time had ceased to
flow, night and day knew not their passage one into the other, for the sky
itself was now a vast canopy of imperial red velvet, embroidered in gold and
held aloft by silver-sheathed poles forty feet high and the size of ship's
masts. The horizons of this velvet sky were secured to protruding stone eyelets
along the second-story galleries by multicolored cotton cords the thickness of
cable.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The centerpiece of the upcoming celebration was an enormous
balance, the scale on which Arangbar's yearly weight would be taken. By that
weight his physicians would foretell the future estate of his body, and if his
weight had increased since the previous year, there was universal rejoicing.
But, greater or less, his weight always seemed to augur well for India. His
physicians inevitably found it reason to forecast another hundred years of his
benevolent rule.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Nor was the balance itself suggestive of anything less than a
portentous occasion. The measure of a king demanded kingly measures. Its
weighing pans were two cushioned platforms, gilded and inlaid with jewels,
suspended from each end of a central beam by heavy gold chains interwoven with
silken cords. The beam itself, and its supports, were carved from rosewood,
inlaid with jewels, and plated with gold leaf.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>This event of universal joy was never witnessed by more than
a few of Arangbar's closest circle. The first tier of court officials were
permitted in watch, family members, favored officers with rank over five
thousand horse, and a minuscule list of select foreign ambassadors.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth tried to look formal and attentive, but his mind
was still reeling from the news. All the way to the Red Fort he had tried to
sort out the implications.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>That crafty bastard Spencer. He well deserves to be Director
of the East India Company. It's perfect. He timed it perfectly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Why did he decide to send a second voyage? Did they
accidentally rendezvous with the <i>Discovery</i> at Bantam? Or was it no
accident? Could Elkington have ordered them north? Or maybe it's some sort of
scheme with the Hollanders? Who could the Captain-General be?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Spencer, you deceiving whoremaster. You double-crossed
Elkington, never told him about the letter from King James, and now you, or
somebody, has double-crossed me.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Or saved the mission.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>There's sure to be a bounty of gifts for Arangbar. If they
can make it around Goa, and avoid the Portugals. . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Ambassador, this way.&quot; Nadir Sharif was standing
near the balance, motioning him to the front.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Ambassador, His Majesty is overjoyed at the news of the
English fleet. He has asked that I seat you here, next to me, so I may
translate the Persian for you and allow you to prepare a full report to your
king.&quot; The prime minister had changed to formal dress, with a tapestried
turban and cloak, under which were skin-tight, pastel-striped pants. He wore a
necklace of enormous pearls and in the sash at his waist was a gold-handled <i>katar
</i>set with emeralds. He was barefoot. “This is an ancient yearly custom of
all the Great Moghuls.''</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth quickly unbuckled his shoes and tossed them by the
edge of the vast carpet, near the arcade.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Seat yourself here next to me and I will explain
everything to you. His Majesty thinks the news of your trading fleet is
extremely auspicious, coming as it did on the first day of his birthday
celebration. He wants to return the honor by allowing you to join him in the
royal circle at the wedding of Prince Allaudin and Princess Layla.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That's very gracious of His Majesty. And when do you
think he's planning to sign the<i> firman </i>approving English trade?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Your <i>firman </i>should be little more than a
formality now, Ambassador. He has already accepted in principle the terms you
requested, but you must realize he is quite preoccupied. I think you will have
what you want in a few more weeks. His Majesty has assumed a natural fondness
for you, but I still foresee various encumbrances from our friends in Goa. Much
depends on the fleet, and what happens if the Portuguese intercept it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Nadir Sharif moved closer and lowered his voice. &quot;You</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>know,
Ambassador, the appearance of your fleet bring nearer the time we should work
more closely together. Someday soon perhaps we can discuss the price of English
wool. I have five <i>jagirs </i>in northern Gujarat that produce superb indigo.
They are convenient to the port of Cambay, just a few <i>kos </i>north of
Surat. And, as it happens, I have a private understanding with the Shahbandar
of Cambay. It may be possible to make arrangements that would help us both
avoid some of the normal customs duties. I suggest we explore it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth looked at him and smiled. I'll trade with you the
day after hell turns to ice, you unscrupulous son of a whore.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Kettledrums sounded at the back of the square and Hawksworth
turned to see Arangbar making his entry followed by Allaudin and a gray-bearded
<i>wazir</i>. The men around Hawksworth bounded to their feet as one, performed
the <i>teslim</i>, and then settled again on the carpets. On Nadir Sharifs
whispered urgings, Hawksworth also rose and bowed, without the <i>teslim </i>.
. . causing Nadir Sharif’s eyes to flash momentary disapproval as they both
resumed their seats.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The Moghul was outfitted in the most magnificent attire
Hawksworth had ever seen. He seemed to be clothed in a fabric of jewels:
diamonds, rubies, pearls were woven into his cloak, and his sword handle
appeared to consist entirely of emeralds. His fingers were covered with jeweled
rings and chains from which dangled walnut-sized rubies. His chest was covered
with sparkling necklaces, and even his turban was bejeweled.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The crowd watched with anticipation as Arangbar strode
directly to the nearest platform of the balance and tested its cushions with a
sparkling hand. He waited with a broad smile while it was lowered to the
carpet, then without a word seated himself onto the cushions, in the hunched
squat all Indians performed. Allaudin and the <i>wazir </i>stood on either side
and steadied him as officials from the mint, all wearing bright red turbans,
approached bearing dark brown bags.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Bag after bag was piled onto the opposite platform, until
Arangbar's side slowly began to levitate off the carpet. When a perfect balance
had been achieved, his side was tipped gently back down by Allaudin and the <i>wazir</i>,
while the officials began to remove and count the bags on the opposite
platform. When the bags were counted, the weighing commenced again, this time
with bags of purple silk.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The first weighing is in silver rupees,&quot; Nadir
Sharif whispered through the reverential silence. &quot;Afterwards they are
taken back to the mint and distributed to the poor by His Majesty. Today is one
of great rejoicing in Agra.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;How much does he weigh?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;His usual weight is about nine thousand silver
rupees.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That's over a thousand pounds in English
sterling.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Is that a large amount in your king's coinage,
Ambassador?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It's a substantial sum of money.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Over the following year, during the evenings, His
Majesty will call the poor of Agra to come before him and he will give them the
money with his own hand.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;How far will nine thousand rupees go to feed all the
poor of Agra?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I don't understand your question, Ambassador?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;Nothing. I . . . I was just wondering if
perhaps King James should do the same.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It is an old Moghul tradition here.&quot; Nadir Sharif
turned back to the scales, where Arangbar was calling for the next weighing.
&quot;But watch. Now he will be weighed against gold <i>mohurs</i>.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The pile of bags was mounting, and again Arangbar's platform
slowly began to rise into the air.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;There are twelve weighings in all. You will see. After
the gold coins, he is weighed against gold cloth that has been given to him on
his birthday by the women of the <i>zenana</i>. Then bags of jewels that were
contributed by the governors of India's provinces, carpets and brocades from
Agra nobles, and so forth. He is also weighed against silk, linen, spices, and
even ghee and grains, which are distributed later to the Hindu merchant
caste.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Arangbar continued to smile serenely as the weighing
proceeded. During the weighing of silk, he spotted Hawksworth and winked,
raising a hand to flash a diamond the size of a bullet. Hawksworth noted wryly
that he had not seen any of the wealth actually being distributed, that it was
all in fact returned directly to the palace.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>When all the weighings were completed, Arangbar drew himself
erect and regally moved to a raised platform that had been constructed at the
back of the arcade. He then signaled for the massive balance to be removed and
in moments it had disappeared into the recesses of the palace.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The crowd had begun to shuffle expectantly. As Hawksworth
watched, he suddenly realized why.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Large covered baskets were being brought before Arangbar, and
when their lids were removed, Hawksworth caught the glisten of silver. Arangbar
took the first basket and stood to his full height on the dais. Then with a
swing he flung the contents over the top of the crowd. The air seemed to rain
silver and the assembled nobles began scrambling over the carpet retrieving the
silver objects. Nadir Sharif picked up one and handed it to Hawksworth.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It was a silver nutmeg, life-sized and topped with a tiny
gold flower. Hawksworth rolled it over . . . and it deflated to a thin piece of
foil.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Arangbar flung another basket and the turmoil intensified.
Only Hawksworth stood firm, as even Nadir Sharif could not resist scooping up
several of the foil replicas of nuts, fruits, and spices that scattered on the
carpet around them. The dignified assemblage had been reduced to bedlam. Then
the beaming Arangbar spotted Hawksworth and called out.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Ambassador Inglish. Is there nothing you would
have?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;May it please Your Majesty, an ambassador of the
English king does not scramble for toys.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then come forward and you'll not have to.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>When Hawksworth reached the dais he bowed lightly, and as he
drew himself up, Arangbar seized the front of his doublet and dumped a basket
of gold foil flowers down the front of his shirt.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Before he could move, the nobles were there, pulling open his
doublet and scooping up the worked foil. In moments his doublet was plucked
clean. He looked about in disbelief, and saw that Arangbar was already tossing
more baskets to the turbaned crowd.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>When the silver and gold were gone, Arangbar spoke quickly to
the eunuchs, and trays appeared with chalices of hard spirits. The assembled
nobles all toasted the Moghul’s health and he joined in as the drinking began.
Musicians appeared, followed by food on plates of silver worked in gold.
Finally hookahs were set about the carpet, together with more drinks, and a singer
arrived to perform an afternoon raga.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;This is an auspicious day for us both, Inglish.&quot;
Arangbar beamed down from his throne as he motioned Hawksworth forward.
&quot;The news just reached me. Was this meant to be a surprise?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The English fleet is my king's birthday gift to Your
Majesty.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Nothing could gratify me more.&quot; Arangbar drank
from a large cup of wine. &quot;We think it might be time we considered sending
an ambassador of our own to the court of your Inglish king. We just sent our
first ambassador to Goa.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;King James would be most honored, Your Majesty.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Tell me, Ambassador Inglish. When will these ships
reach the port at Surat?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It depends on whether the Portugals want to honor the
treaty between Spain and England and allow our fleet to pass unchallenged.
Sailing up from the islands will mean tacking against the wind, but the fleet
could possibly make landfall within a month.&quot; Hawksworth paused.
&quot;Your Majesty must realize this adds urgency to the matter of the trading <i>firman</i>.''</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Within the week or so, Inglish. Within a week or
so.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Hawksworth caught a slight elevation of Nadir
Sharif’s eyebrows.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;How long now do you intend to be staying with us,
Inglish?&quot; Arangbar popped a ball of opium into his mouth . . . a bit too
early in the day, Hawksworth thought.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Until you've signed the <i>firman </i>for trade, Your
Majesty. I'll return it to King James by the next shipping west.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We would prefer that you stayed with us awhile longer,
Inglish.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;No one regrets more than I that it's not possible, Your
Majesty. But my king awaits Your Majesty's pleasure regarding the terms of the <i>firman</i>.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;We have conceived a new idea, Inglish. We will
send the ito your king by our own ambassador. Then you can remain here with us
until your king sends another ambassador to replace you.&quot; Arangbar
laughed. &quot;But he must be a man who drinks as well as you, or we may send
him back.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth felt his stomach tighten. &quot;Who can say when
another ambassador will be sent, Your Majesty? Should Your Majesty approve the <i>firman</i>,
my duties here will be <i>Resolve</i>d.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But you must remain here to ensure we keep our word,
Inglish.&quot; Arangbar winked broadly. &quot;Else our heart could grow
fickle.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I am honored, Your Majesty.&quot; Hawksworth shifted.
&quot;But my first duty is to my king.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We have been thinking perhaps you should have other
duties . . .&quot; Arangbar's voice trailed off as he sipped on his wine and
studied Hawksworth. Then he looked up and his glance fell on the Portuguese
Jesuits lingering at the back of the courtyard. As he examined them, he recalled
the many long evenings when he had allowed the Jesuit Pinheiro and his
superior, Father Sarmento, to debate with him the merits of Christianity. And
again he found himself marveling how refreshingly different the Englishman was.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Out of curiosity he had once inquired of the Jesuits how
exactly a king such as himself could become a Christian, and the very first
thing they had said was he must select only one of all his wives and dismiss
the rest.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He had tried to point out to them the absurdity of allowing a
man only one wife, without even the option to rid oneself of her once she grew
tiresome. And what, he had asked, was this king to do if his single remaining
wife suddenly became blind one day? Was he to keep her still? Of course, they
had replied, blindness in no way interferes with the act of marriage. And what
if she becomes a leper? Patience, they had counseled, aided by God's grace,
which renders all things easy. Such patience, he had pointed out, might be
customary for a Jesuit, who had abstained from women all his life, but what
about one who had not? And they had replied that Christians also were sometimes
known to sin, but that the Grace of Christ provided the remedy of penitence,
even for those who transgressed against the law of chastity. He had listened
with mounting astonishment as they next proceeded to describe how Jesuits
scourged themselves to still the fires of the flesh.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>At this last, he had realized that Christian doctrines were
incomprehensible and unworthy of further inquiry. From that time forward he had
never bothered to take the Jesuits seriously.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But this Englishman is different, he told himself. A real
man, who'll drink a cup of wine or eye a pretty woman with plenty of unchaste
thoughts on his sleeve.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;From this day forth you'll be serving us, Inglish, as
well as your king. We have decided to make you a <i>khan</i>.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth stared at him uncomprehending. A murmur swept the
crowd, but quickly died away to stunned silence.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;A <i>khan</i>, Your Majesty?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;<i>Khan</i> is a title given to high-ranking officers in
our service. It carries with it great honor. And a salary. No <i>feringhi </i>has
ever before been made a <i>khan </i>by us. You will be the first.&quot; He
laughed broadly. &quot;So now you must stay in India and drink with us. You are
in our hire.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm flattered by Your Majesty's generosity.&quot;
Hawksworth found himself stunned—by the honor and also by the disquieting
implications for his planned return to England. &quot;What are the duties of a <i>khan</i>?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;First, Inglish, we must have a ceremony, to invest you
properly.&quot; Arangbar seemed to ignore the looks of disbelief on the faces
around him. &quot;You will be given a personal honorary rank, called <i>zat</i>,
of four hundred. And a horse rank, called <i>suwar</i>, of fifty.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;Does it mean I have to maintain that many
cavalry?&quot; Hawksworth blanched, realizing his money was already growing
short.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;If you do, you will be the first <i>khan </i>in India
who ever did. No, Inglish, you will be provided salary for that number, but you
need not maintain more than twenty or thirty. We will personally select them
for you after the wedding.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Arangbar turned and motioned to Nadir Sharif. The prime
minister came forward and one of the eunuchs handed him a small box, of
teakwood worked in gold. He motioned for Hawksworth to kneel directly in front
of Arangbar. The nobles around them still could not disguise their astonished
looks.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Nadir Sharif moved directly above where Hawksworth was
kneeling and opened the box. &quot;His Majesty, by this symbol, initiates you
into discipleship. It is bestowed only on the very few.&quot; He took out a small
gold medal, attached to a chain, and slipped the chain over Hawksworth's head.
Hawksworth noted that the medal had the likeness of Arangbar imprinted on both
sides. &quot;Now you must prostrate yourself before His Majesty.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;May it please His Majesty, the ambassador of a king
must show his gratitude after the custom of his own country,&quot; Hawksworth
replied to Nadir Sharif, then bowed lightly to Arangbar. &quot;I humbly thank
Your Majesty in the name of King James.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Nadir Sharif’s face darkened. &quot;You must <i>teslim </i>to
His Majesty.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;No, not the Inglish.&quot; Arangbar waved Nadir Sharif
aside. &quot;He must follow his own custom. Now, give him the pearl.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Nadir Sharif took a large pearl from the box and stood before
Hawksworth.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;This you must wear in your left ear, where your gold
earring is now.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth examined the pearl. It was immense, and perfect.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Again I thank Your Majesty.&quot; Hawksworth looked up
to see Arangbar beaming. &quot;How shall I wear it?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;My jeweler will fit it for you, Inglish.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>A wry, portly man stepped forward and quickly
removed the small gold earring from Hawksworth's ear. Just as deftly, he
attached the pearl where it had been.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And now, Inglish, I will bestow on you the highest
favor of my court.&quot; He turned and signaled another eunuch to come forward.
The eunuch carried a cloak woven with gold. &quot;This cloak I have myself
worn, then kept aside to bestow on a worthy disciple. It is for you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Arangbar took the cloak himself and laid it over Hawksworth's
shoulders.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I thank Your Majesty. The honor is more than I could
ever merit.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That may well be true, Inglish.&quot; Arangbar roared.
&quot;But it's yours. You speak my tongue and you drink almost as well. Few men
here today can equal you. And you have the wits of ten Portuguese. I think you
deserve to be one of my <i>khans</i>.&quot; Arangbar signaled for him to rise.
&quot;Your salary will begin with the next lunar month. After that you will be
known in this court as the Inglish Khan. Day after tomorrow you will ride with
us in <i>shikar</i>, the royal hunt. You may soon decide you like India better
than England. Have you ever seen a tiger?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Never, Your Majesty.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You will soon enough. Day after tomorrow. So you had
best do your drinking now, for tigers require a clear head.&quot; Arangbar
laughed again and clapped and the tension in the courtyard semed to evaporate.
The singer immediately began a second raga.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As Hawksworth fingered the earring, the medal, and the cloak,
he found himself remembering Huyghen's burning eyes that day in the London
alehouse. &quot;You'll forget who you are,&quot; the old seaman had said. Could
this be what he meant?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But maybe it's not so bad after all, he told himself. It's
like a dream come true. And when the fleet makes landfall. . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>. . . &quot;Of course I've heard. It was my idea. Although
His Majesty naturally assumes he thought of it all by himself. Making the <i>feringhi
</i>a <i>khan </i>will confuse the Portuguese. And it will take everyone's mind
off the <i>firman </i>for a while.&quot; Queen Janahara had received Nadir
Sharif immediately after Arangbar retired to the <i>zenana</i> for his
afternoon dalliance. The balcony of the Jasmine Tower was empty, the servants
all ordered back to the <i>zenana</i>. I'm more interested in the English
fleet. Do you know what has happened?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What do you mean, Majesty?&quot; Nadir Sharif noted
that he had not been invited to sit.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;There was another message today, a private message from
His Excellency, Miguel Vaijantes.&quot; Janahara raised a silver,
hourglass-shaped cuspidor to her lips and delicately discharged red betel
juice. &quot;Can you guess what he has dared to do?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What do you mean?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Miguel Vaijantes is a man without courage. The
understanding was very clear.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The understanding, Your Majesty?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We have kept our side of the agreement. There has been
no <i>firman </i>for the English <i>feringhi</i>. But now His Excellency has
declared that he must off-load the arms. He has begun assembling an armada to
sail north and intercept the English.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The arms, Your Majesty?&quot; Nadir Sharif moved
closer. &quot;Miguel Vaijantes was shipping arms?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Surely you knew. My dear brother, has anything ever
escaped your rapacious eyes.&quot; She smiled, then spat again. &quot;For
Ahmadnagar. Small arms and cannon.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You were arming Malik Ambar? Against Jadar?&quot; Nadir
Sharif could not strain the surprise from his voice.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We were not arming him. The Portuguese were. Miguel
Vaijantes was to have armed a Maratha division on the western coast,
off-loading at a Portuguese port called Bom Bahia, on the coast west of
Ahmadnagar. He had his own reasons, but now it seems he has lost his nerve. I
had no idea how alarmed these Portuguese were by the English.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Nadir Sharifs mind was reeling. Say something, anything.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;If I may inject a word on His Excellency's
behalf, Majesty, you must understand that matters between the Portuguese and
the English are extremely delicate at the moment.&quot; Nadir Sharif’s voice grew
more statesmanlike as he spoke. He scarcely heard his own words as his mind
plowed through the consequences of it all. And the treachery. &quot;The English
could conceivably interrupt the entire trade of the Portuguese. All the prince
could ever possibly do would be to tighten restrictions on our ports at Surat
and Cambay. The Viceroy's decision is clearly strategic, nothing more. I'm sure
the regard he holds for Your Majesty remains undiminished.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That is a touching consolation.&quot; Janahara's voice
was frigid, and she seemed suddenly much older.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Footsteps sounded through the marble corridor and Allaudin
appeared at the doorway. He had changed to a foppish green turban, set off by
an effeminate necklace of rubies. His elaborate <i>katar </i>was secured by a
sash of gold- threaded brocade, and an emerald was set at the top of each
slipper. He wore heavy perfume.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Your Majesty.&quot; He salaamed to Queen Janahara and
then stood attentively, somewhat sheepishly, until she gestured for him to sit.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You're late.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I was detained in my quarters, Majesty.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Janahara seemed completely preoccupied, unable even to look
at the prince. &quot;The question now is what to do about the Englishman.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Allaudin did not trouble to
mask his sneer. &quot;It's perfectly clear. His Majesty adores the <i>feringhi</i>.
He'll surely sign the <i>firman</i> for English trade. Then there'll be a war
on the seas. It's really most exciting.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The <i>firman</i> is not yet signed.&quot; Janahara
moved to the balcony and studied the river below. Her walk was purposeful, yet
still the perfection of elegance. &quot;Nor do I think it ever will be. His
Majesty will not have the time. The wedding will be moved forward. Before His
Highness, Prince Jadar, has the leisure to trouble us more.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Janahara turned and examined the two men, one her brother and
one her future son-in-law, finding herself astonished by their credulity.
Somehow, she told herself, the hand of Jadar lies behind all this. The
coincidence was just too great. First, he had succeeded in raising troops from
the southern <i>mansabdars</i>. And now the Deccanis could not be armed. Could
he possibly still forge a peace in the Deccan. Still, after the wedding he
would be isolated. Then what he did would no longer matter. But if the <i>firman
</i>were signed, there would no longer be leverage with the Portuguese.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Janahara looked directly at Nadir Sharif. &quot;If His
Majesty signs the <i>firman </i>before the wedding, you will be held
responsible.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I understand, Majesty.&quot; Nadir Sharif shifted.
&quot;When will the wedding be?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I think it would be auspicious to hold it the week
following the birthday celebration. Which means the preparations must begin
now.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Hold the wedding immediately after the hunt? There's
scarcely time.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;There will be time. For that and more.&quot; Janahara
turned to Allaudin. &quot;And you would do well to start spending more time

long if you are a match for Jadar. I pray to Allah I don't already suspect the
answer.&quot;</span></p>

&quot;There, on that hill, Inglish, is where I was born.&quot; Arangbar pointed
to the high sandstone walls of a distant hilltop fortress, outlined against the
midday sky. &quot;It's called Fatehpur Sekri. It was a great city during the
time of my father Akman, but now it's abandoned. It's romantic, but it's also
forbidding. I've only been back once in my life, and that was enough.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth's elephant was half a length behind those of
Arangbar and Allaudin, even with that of Nadir Sharif. It was the second
morning of their ride, and they were nearing the locale of the royal hunt. It
seemed to him that half of Agra had traveled along. The queen and her retinue
were behind them, as were many of Arangbar's favorite women, his guard, his
eunuchs, the entire palace staff. The location of the hunt was a two-day ride
from Agra.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What's there now?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It's abandoned, Inglish. Except for a few Sufi Muslims.
They were there before, and I guess they'll be there forever.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What do you mean 'they were there before'? Before
what?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Ah, Inglish. We had a very romantic birth. You seem to
know nothing of it. You see, my father, the Great Akman, had tried for many
years to have a son before I was born. Many hundreds of women, Inglish, but not
one could give him a son. Once twin boys were born to a Rajput princess he had
wived, but both died a few days later. Gradually he became obsessed with fears
of death, of dying without a lineage, and he began calling holy men to the <i>Diwan-i-Khas
</i>every evening to question them about mortality. Once a Hindu holy man came
who told Akman the greatest duty of a king is to leave a male heir, who can
carry his lineage forward. The Great Akman was plunged into even greater
sadness by this, and he <i>Resolve</i>d to renounce everything until he could
have a son.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;He walked all the way from Agra to that mountain,
Inglish.&quot; Arangbar pointed toward the fortress. &quot;He came to see a
holy Sufi living there, among the rocks and wild beasts. It was a momentous
meeting. Akman fell at the feet of the holy man, and the Sufi held out his arms
in welcome to the Great Moghul of India. In later years many of Akman's artists
painted the scene. Akman told him that he had come to find the peace of Allah.
To find his own destiny. As a seeker after truth. The Sufi offered this great
warrior berries to eat, and gave him his own simple hut for an abode. Akman
stayed for many days, meditating with the Sufi, and finally, when he made ready
to leave, the Sufi told him he would have three sons.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And now,&quot; Arangbar grinned, &quot;we reach the
interesting part. When next a wife announced she was with child, Akman moved
her out here, to stay in the same abode as the holy man. And, as the Sufi
predicted, a male child was born.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And the child was . . .&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;You are riding beside him, Inglish. That is
the story of my birth. Akman was so elated that he decided to build an entire
city here, and move the capital from Agra. He built the city, but it was an
obvious act of excess. He never found time to live there, and soon it was
abandoned. So now the mountain is like it was before my birth, home to wild
birds and a few mad Sufis. The only difference is they have a magnificent
abandoned city to live in, instead of straw huts.&quot; He laughed again.
&quot;Perhaps I owe my very life to a Sufi. Incidentally, descendants of that
holy man still live there.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Are they all Sufis?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Who knows, Inglish? I think holy men from all over
India can be found there from time to time. It's become a kind of
retreat.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'd like permission to visit it sometime,
Majesty.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Of course, Inglish. You'll find it's magnificent.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth squinted against the sun and studied the distant
red walls of the city-fortress. Something about its remote purity beckoned him.
After the hunt, he told himself, when there's time. Right after the hunt.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Arangbar fell silent, and Hawksworth leaned back in his <i>howdah
</i>as it rocked gently along. Elephants made better mounts than he had first
suspected. He thought again of the previous morning, and his first reaction
when told he would be riding an elephant for the next two days. He had arrived
at the Red Fort, to be greeted by Nadir Sharif, who directed him to the royal
elephants being readied in the courtyard of the <i>Diwan-i-Am</i>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;His Majesty has selected one of his favorites for you.
Her name is Kumada.&quot; Nadir Sharif had pointed toward a large female
elephant, her body dyed black and festooned with golden bells, yak-tail
tassels, gold tusk rings.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What does the name mean?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The infidel Hindus believe the eight points of the
earth are each guarded by a heavenly being in the shape of an elephant. Your
English fleet is coming to us out of our ocean from the southwest, and Kumada
is the name Hindus give to the elephant who guards that point of the Hindu
compass. His Majesty believes this elephant will be auspicious for you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm most grateful to His Majesty.&quot; Hawksworth
surveyed the assembled crowd in astonishment. Around him nobles wearing jeweled
turbans and silk trousers were selecting elephants. He had worn sea boots and a
leather jerkin.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Nadir Sharif signaled toward the mahout perched atop the neck
of Kumada, and the man tapped her flapping ear with a short barbed rod and gave
her directions in Hindi as he guided her toward Hawksworth. She lumbered
forward to where Hawksworth stood, and then her mountainous flesh seemed to
roll like a wave as she kneeled, front legs out, back legs bent at the knee,
ready to be mounted. Two keepers were there, opening the gate of the
gold-trimmed <i>howdah </i>and then kneeling, ready to hoist the <i>feringhi</i>
aboard.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Have you ever ridden an elephant before, Ambassador?&quot;
Nadir Sharif monitored Hawksworth's apprehensive expression with delight.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Never. I've never actually been this close to one
before.&quot; Hawksworth eyed the elephant warily, mistrusting her seeming
docility. Elizabethans circulated fabulous tales about this mountainous beast,
that it could pull down great trees with the power of its trunk, that it had
two hearts—one it used when calm, the other when incensed—and that in Ethiopia
there were dragons who killed elephants merely to drink their blood, said to be
ice cold at all times.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You will find an elephant has more wit than most men.
His Majesty keeps a thousand in his stables here in the Red Fort. The Great
Akman used to trap them in the wild, using a female in heat, but then he
learned to induce tame ones to couple. Your elephant, I believe, is
second-ranked. She's a fine-tempered animal.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Kumada examined Hawksworth with her sad, dark eyes, and waved
her fanlike ears skeptically.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm not entirely sure she's taken to me.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;Here, Ambassador.&quot; Nadir Sharif slipped a
paper-wrapped stick of sugarcane into Hawksworth's hand and nodded his head
toward the elephant.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth gingerly approached her and began unwrapping the
paper. No sooner was the cane in view than Kumada nipped it deftly from his
hand with a flourish of her trunk. She popped the cane into her mouth and
flapped her ears with obvious pleasure as she cracked it with her immense
teeth. For a second Hawksworth thought he caught a flash of appreciation in her
eyes. He paused a moment, then walked close enough to stroke the heavy skin at
her neck.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;She'll not forget you now, Ambassador.&quot; Nadir
Sharif was feeding his own elephant. &quot;It's said these animals have a
memory longer than a man's.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth vaulted into the <i>howdah </i>and the entire
world suddenly seemed to shudder as her mahout signaled Kumada to rise. He
seized the railing surrounding him and gasped as she rumbled to her feet.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You'll soon ride like a Rajput, Ambassador.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The elephant rocked into motion. It was worse than heavy
weather at sea.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I think it may take practice.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Women from the <i>zenana </i>ride elephants all the way
to Kashmir in the summer. I'm sure you'll manage a two-day hunt.&quot; Nadir
Sharif swung easily into his howdah. Around them other elephants were kneeling
for nobles to mount.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Where will the hunt be?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;This time we're going west, out toward the old city of
Fatehpur Sekri. But His Majesty has hunting preserves all over. In the
neighborhood of Agra and near the small town of Delhi north of here, along the
course of the Jamuna and reaching into the mountains, there is much
uncultivated land. There are many places with grasses over six feet high and
copse wood. This land is guarded with great care by the army, and no person,
high or low, is allowed to hunt there except for partridge, quail, and
hare—which are caught with nets. So the game—nilgai, deer, antelope, <i>chitah</i>,
tiger, even some lions—is plentiful. Some of His Majesty's hunting preserves
may extend as far as ten <i>kos </i>in every direction—I believe that's around
twenty of your miles.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You said preparations for the hunt had been underway
for days?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Of course. When His Majesty announces a <i>shikar</i>,
a royal hunt, the grand master of the hunt in that particular location has to
begin extensive preparations. The hunts now are usually a <i>qamargha</i>,
which was invented by Akman.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What's that?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;First, sentries are posted on all the roads leading
into the preserve to keep villagers out, and then the entire preserve is
surrounded by beaters, we call them <i>qarawals</i>, who begin to close the circle
and drive in the game. For this week's hunt he used thirty thousand <i>qarawals</i>.
The grand master of the hunt informs His Majesty when the game has been brought
together. The next day the court and officers from the army leave early, to be
at the appointed place to meet His Majesty when he arrives. His Majesty usually
hunts alone at first, if there are no tigers, and everyone else must wait at a
distance of about one <i>kos</i>. Only some members of the Imperial army are
allowed to accompany him, for protection. After His Majesty wearies of the
kill, then others of his choosing are allowed to kill the last of the game. But
if tigers are to be hunted, it's customary that only His Majesty and the royal
family enter the circle. It's always been the tradition of Moghul rulers that
only they and their kinsmen are allowed to hunt tigers. But this hunt will be
different. This time His Majesty will merely watch.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Who'll do the killing then?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That my surprise you, Ambassador. Let me merely say
that it is no man. You will see.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth was still wondering what he meant. But the time
was not far away when he would know. They were nearing the area that Nadir
Sharif had said was designated for the hunt.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Inglish,&quot; Arangbar shouted back over his shoulder.
&quot;Does your king hunt?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Rarely, Your Majesty. But he has no elephants.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Perhaps we should send him some. But then I assume he
has no tigers either. Should we also send him some tigers to run free in
Ingland so he can hunt them?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'll remember to ask His Majesty.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But first you must see our tigers for yourself,
Inglish. Today you and Nadir Sharif will join us as we go into the <i>qur</i>,
the hunting round. Have your elephants fitted with leather armor.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Nadir Sharif started with surprise. &quot;I thank Your
Majesty for the honor.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Allaudin stirred in his <i>howdah</i>, and Hawksworth caught
the disdain in his eyes. &quot;Majesty, why are you inviting the <i>feringhi </i>into
the <i>qur</i>?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;Her Majesty suggested it. And it amuses
me.&quot; Arangbar seemed to dismiss Allaudin's question. &quot;He will not
have a weapon. All he'll do is watch.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As servants rushed forward to begin fitting the leather
armor, Hawksworth saw the queen's elephant approach. This was the closest he
had ever been to her, and still he could not see her. Her <i>howdah </i>was
completely enclosed with curtains, which now flapped lightly in the midday
breeze.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Her Majesty, Queen Janahara, will be going into the
hunting circle.&quot; Nadir Sharifs voice was discreet as he spoke to
Hawksworth. &quot;She rarely joins in <i>shikar</i>, but she is an excellent
shot. This is a rare honor for you, Ambassador.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth studied the closed howdah and wondered why the
&quot;honor&quot; seemed to leave him with such an uneasy feeling.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The waiting nobles formed a line with their
elephants as the Imperial entourage moved past. Armed guards followed on
horseback at a distance. Leather padding had been fitted over the face and
shanks of Hawksworth's and Nadir Sharif’s elephants, and they joined the end of
the procession.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth held firmly to the side of the <i>howdah </i>as
his elephant rocked along, with only occasional instructions from her mahout.
Now they followed a winding road, which was surrounded on either side by tall,
brown grass. He warily studied every sway of the grass, imagining tigers
waiting to spring.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Why don't we have guns?&quot; He turned to Nadir
Sharif, who rode alongside, rocking placidly in his swaying howdah.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;There's no need, Ambassador. I told you the tiger will
not be killed with guns today. Of course, His Majesty and Prince Allaudin have
guns, but they're merely for protection, in case there's some minor
difficulty.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Minor difficulty? What are <i>we </i>supposed to do if
there's a 'minor difficulty'?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;The army will be there, men with
half-pikes.&quot; He smiled easily. &quot;You're in no danger.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Ahead the woods seemed to open up, and the grass was shorter,
perhaps only as high as a man's waist. Deer darted wildly from side to side,
contained by high nets that had been erected around the sides of the clearing.
As they approached, Hawksworth saw a long line of several hundred water buffalo
waiting, heavy bovine animals with thick curved horns dipping back against
their heads, each fitted with a leather saddle and reined by a rider on its
back. The reins, which passed through the buffalo's nostrils, were held in one
hand by a mounted soldier, whose other hand grasped a naked broadsword.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Those men may well be the bravest soldiers in the
army.&quot; Nadir Sharif pointed to the riders, who were all saluting
Arangbar's arrival. &quot;Theirs is a task I do not envy.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What do they do?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You will see for yourself, Ambassador, in just a few
moments.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>From beyond the other side of the clearing, as though on an
agreed signal, came the sound of beaters. As the Imperial elephants drew near
the gray line of buffalo, their riders began to urge them ahead. The buffalo
snorted, knowing what waited in the grass, and then they lumbered forward,
tossing their heads in disquiet. The line of buffalo was curved in the shape of
a half-moon, and Arangbar urged his elephant directly behind them. The grass
ahead swarmed with frightened game, as deer and antelope dashed against the
nets and were thrown back, and from the woods beyond, the clatter and shouts of
the beaters increased.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Suddenly from out of the grass a tawny head appeared, with
gold and black stripes and heavy whiskers. The animal dashed for the side of
the enclosure, sprang for freedom, and was thrown back by the heavy net.
Hawksworth watched it speechless, unprepared for the size and ferocity of an
Indian tiger. It was enormous, with powerful haunches and a long striped tail.
The tiger flipped to its feet and turned to face the line of buffalo with an
angry growl.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Arangbar clapped his hands with delight and shouted in Urdu
to the line of riders, all—Hawksworth now realized— Rajputs. The buffalo
snorted and tried to turn back, but their riders whipped them forward. The
tiger assumed a crouching stalk along the gray, horned wall, eyeing a large
dark buffalo with a bearded rider. Then it sprang.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The buffalo's head went down, and when it came up a heavy
curved horn had pierced the tiger's neck. There was a snort and a savage toss
of the head that flung the wounded tiger upward. As it whirled in the air,
Hawksworth saw a deep gash across its throat. The Rajput riders nearby slipped
to the ground and formed a wall of swords between Arangbar and the tiger as the
line of buffalo closed in, bellowing for the kill. In what seemed only moments
the tiger was horned and pawed to a lifeless pulp.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Superb!&quot; Arangbar shouted something to the
enclosed <i>howdah </i>that Hawksworth did not understand. &quot;A hundred gold
<i>mohurs</i> to every man on the line.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The Rajputs remounted their buffalo, retrieving the reins
from the bloody grass, and the line again moved forward.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;This is a variation on His Majesty's usual tiger
hunt,&quot; Nadir Sharif shouted through the dust, above the din of bellowing
buffalo and trumpeting elephants. &quot;Often he shoots, but today His Majesty
elected merely to watch. Actually, animal fights have long been a favorite
pastime in India.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>At that moment a pair of tigers emerged from the grass and
stared at the approaching line of buffalo. They did not seem frightened, as had
the first, and they watched the line coolly, as though selecting a strategy.
Then they dropped into a crouching stalk, moving directly toward the center of
the line.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth noticed Arangbar suddenly order his mahout to hold
back his elephant. The other Imperial elephants had also paused to wait. Then
Arangbar turned and ordered the servant who rode behind him to pass forward a
long-barreled, large-caliber sporting piece. Allaudin, whose fright was
transparent, also signaled for a gun.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth's mahout pulled his elephant directly behind
Arangbar's, as though for protection.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The tigers seemed in no hurry to engage the buffalo. They
scrutinized the approaching line and waited for their moment. Then, when the
buffalo were no more than ten feet away, both sprang simultaneously.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The female was speared on the horn of a buffalo, but she
flipped in midair and sank her teeth into the leather shielding on its neck. As
its Rajput rider slipped to the ground, the male of the pair dashed past his
mate and sprang for him. The Rajput swung his broadsword, catching the tiger in
the flank, but it swatted him aside with a powerful sweep of its paw and he
crumpled, his neck shattered. Other Rajputs rushed the male tiger with their
swords, as their buffalo closed in to kill the female, but it eluded their
thrusts as it circled Arangbar's elephant. Soldiers with half-pikes had already
rushed to form a barricade between Arangbar's elephant and the tiger, but the
Moghul seemed unperturbed. While the panting male tiger stalked Arangbar, the
female tiger was forgotten.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As Hawksworth watched spellbound, his pulse pounding, he
caught a yellow flicker out of the corner of his eye and turned to see the
female tiger slip past the ring of buffalo and dash toward the rear of
Arangbar's elephant. It was on the opposite side from the armed soldiers, where
the Moghul’s elephant was undefended.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth opened his mouth to shout just as the female tiger
sprang for Arangbar, but at that moment a shot rang out from the enclosed
howdah of Queen Janahara and the female tiger crumpled in midair, curving into
a lifeless ball as it smashed against the side of the Moghul’s mount.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The jolt caused Arangbar's shot at the male tiger to go wide,
merely grazing its foreleg. A dozen half-pikes pierced its side as it stumbled
forward, and it whirled to slap at the Rajputs. Allaudin also fired his tiger
gun, but his shot missed entirely, almost hitting one of the men trying to hold
the tiger back. It whirled in a bloody circle for a moment, and then stopped.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It was staring at Hawksworth.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He heard his mahout shout in terror as the tiger sprang for
the head of their elephant. A wrap of yellow fur seemed to twist itself around
the elephant's forehead as the tiger dug its claws into the protective leather
padding. As Kumada tossed her head in panic, the mahout screamed again and
plunged for safety, rolling through a clump of brown grass and scrambling
toward the soldiers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The tiger caught Hawksworth's eyes with a hypnotic gaze as it
began pulling itself over the forehead of the terrified elephant, directly
toward his howdah. Kumada had begun to whirl in a circle and shake her head,
futilely trying to dislodge the wounded fury slashing at her leather armor. The
tiger slipped momentarily, then caught its claws more firmly and began to climb
again.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Almost without thinking, Hawksworth reached forward and
grabbed the <i>ankus</i>, the short pike and claw used for guiding an elephant,
that the mahout had left lodged in a leather fold behind the elephant's head.
He wrenched it free and began to tease the tiger back.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Kumada was running now, wildly it seemed, toward a large <i>pipal
</i>tree at the edge of the clearing. But the tiger had pulled itself atop her
head and, as Hawksworth jabbed its whiskered face with the <i>ankus</i>, he
heard a deep growl and saw a flash of yellow and claw as a sharp pain cut
through his shoulder.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He knew he was falling, dizzily, hands grasping against
smooth leather as he slipped past the neck of the elephant, past its flapping
ear, against a thundering foot that slammed the dust next to his face.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Kumada had suddenly stopped dead still, throwing him
sprawling against the base of the <i>pipal </i>tree. He looked up to see the
tiger suspended above him, glaring down, clawing at the face of the elephant
and bellowing with pain.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then he heard the snap of the tiger's spine, as Kumada
slammed it again and again against the massive trunk of the</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>tree, Only
when the tiger was motionless did she let it drop, carefully tossing its body
away from Hawksworth as it tumbled lifeless onto the grass.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth looked up through the dust to see Arangbar pulling
his elephant alongside.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That was most auspicious, Inglish. It's an ominous and
evil protent for the state if a tiger I have shot escapes the hunt. If that
beast had succeeded in going free, we would have had to send the entire army
into the countryside to find and kill it. Your Kumada saved me the trouble. The
gods of the southwest have been auspicious for our reign today. I think you
brought us luck.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I thank Your Majesty.&quot; Hawksworth found himself
gasping for breath.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;No, it is you we must thank. You were quick-witted
enough to keep the tiger where Kumada could crush it.&quot; Arangbar called for
his own elephant to kneel, and he walked briskly to Kumada, who was still
quivering from fright. He stroked her face beneath the eye and she gentled
perceptibly. It was obvious she loved Arangbar. &quot;She's magnificent. Only
once before have I ever seen an elephant do that. I hereby promote her
immediately to First Rank, even though a female.&quot; He turned to Nadir
Sharif. &quot;Have it recorded.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As Hawksworth tried to rise, he felt a bolt of pain through
the shoulder where the tiger had slapped him. He looked to see his leather
jerkin shredded. Arangbar seemed to notice it too and he turned and motioned to
Nadir Sharif, who signaled to another man, who called yet another. Moments
later a physician was bending over Hawksworth. He probed the skin for a painful
moment and then slammed a knee against Hawksworth's side, giving the pained arm
a quick twist.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth heard himself cry out from the pain and for a
moment he thought he might lose consciousness. But then his mind began to clear
and he realized he could move the arm again. The pain was already starting to
abate.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I suggest the shoulder be treated with compresses for a
few days, Majesty.&quot; Nadir Sharif had dismounted from his elephant and was
there, attentive as always.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then he must be sent back to Agra.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Of course, Majesty.&quot; Nadir Sharif stepped closer
to Arangbar. &quot;But perhaps it would be equally wise to let the <i>feringhi </i>rest
somewhere near here. Perhaps at the old city.&quot; He turned and pointed
toward the west. &quot;There at Fatehpur. I think there may still be a few Sufi
hermits there who could attend the shoulder until <i>shikar </i>is over. Then
he could return with us.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Arangbar turned and shaded his eyes as he stared at
the horizon. Above the tree line could be seen the gate of the fortress at
Fatehpur Sekri.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But my shoulder is fine now.&quot; Hawksworth tried to
move into the circle of conversation. &quot;There's no need . . .&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Very reasonable.&quot; Arangbar seemed to ignore
Hawksworth as he turned back to Nadir Sharif. &quot;You can escort the Inglish
to the fortress. Call up a palanquin for him. Leave your elephant here and take
a horse.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As the physician bound Hawksworth's arm in readiness, a
palanquin was brought from among the women's elephants. &quot;A contingent of
Rajputs can go with him.&quot; Arangbar shouted instructions to the captain of
his guard and watched the men fall into formation. Then he remounted his
elephant and signaled for the buffalo to resume their sweep of the tall grass.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As the party started forward, Hawksworth saw Nadir Sharif
shout orders to one of the servants attending him. And as four Rajputs lifted
Hawksworth's palanquin off the ground, a servant rushed forward to shove a
flask inside.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It was brandy. Hawksworth turned to see Nadir Sharif
grinning, a gleam in his eye.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She watched the palanquin ease up the weathered, winding path
leading to the fortress gate. The procession had moved slowly through the gate
at the northeast corner of the city's walls and now the Rajputs were clustered
around the palanquin and the lone rider. The night was still, awash in a wild
desert fragrance, and the moon was curing slowly from white to a rarified gold.
Her vantage, in a corner turret of the wall, was shadow-less and perfect. She
examined the rider and smiled when she recognized the face.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Nadir Sharif. You have kept your part of the bargain. All of
it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As she studied him through the half light, she wondered why
they were coming a day earlier than planned. Then the palanquin stopped and the
other figure emerged. She hesitated before looking, at last forcing herself,
willing her eyes to see.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>After a long moment she turned to the tall man standing next
to her. His beard was white, as were his robes. His eyes saw what she saw, but
he did not smile. He turned to her and nodded wordlessly. Then he tightened his
white robe and moved easily down the stone staircase toward the courtyard
below.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth had sensed the autumn light begin to fall rapidly
as they approached the gates of the fortress-city. Already there was a pale
moon, promising fullness. In size and grandeur the portals of the gate reminded
Hawksworth of the Red Fort in Agra, only the walls themselves were considerably
less formidable. The palace itself sat atop a wooded hill, and already the
stones of the abandoned roadway leading up the hill were becoming overgrown.
There was a small village at the bottom of the hill, where smoke from evening
cooking fires had begun to rise, but from the fortress itself there was no
smoke, no hint of life or habitation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He alighted from the palanquin at the bottom of a steep
stairway leading to the palace gate and together with Nadir Sharif passed
slowly up the abandoned steps. The Rajputs trailed behind them as they reached
the top and passed under the shadow of a tulip-curved arch that framed the
gateway. The dark surrounded them like an envelope, and the Rajput guards
pushed forward, toward the black outline of two massive wooden doors at the
back of the recess. They pushed open the doors, and before them lay a vast open
courtyard, empty in the moonlight.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Is this place completely abandoned? I still don't
understand why I'm here.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Nadir Sharif smiled. &quot;On the contrary, Ambassador. It's
far from abandoned. But it appears so, does it not?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then Hawksworth saw a figure approaching them, gliding
noiselessly across the red sandstone pavement of the court. The figure carried
an oil lamp, which illuminated a bearded face framed in a white shawl.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You are welcome in the name of Allah.&quot; The figure
bowed a greeting. &quot;What brings armed men to our door? It is too late now
to pray. We long ago sounded the last <i>azan</i>.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;His Majesty has sent a <i>feringhi </i>here, to be
cared for by you for two days.&quot; Nadir Sharif stepped forward. &quot;He was
injured today during <i>shikar</i>.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Our hands are always open.&quot; The figure turned and
moved across the plaza toward a building that looked, in the new moonlight, to
be a mosque. When they reached the entrance, the man turned and spoke to the
Rajputs in a language Hawksworth did not understand.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;He says this is the house of God,&quot; Nadir Sharif
translated. &quot;He has commanded the Rajputs to leave their shoes and their
weapons here if they wish to follow. I think they will refuse. Perhaps it would
be best if we all left you now. You'll be well cared for. Day after tomorrow
I'll send a horse for you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What's going on? You mean I'm going to be here
alone?&quot; Hawksworth suddenly realized he was being abandoned, at an
abandoned city. He whirled on Nadir Sharif. &quot;You suggested this. You
brought me here. What the hell is this for? I could have returned to Agra, or
even stayed with the hunt.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You're a perceptive man, Ambassador.&quot; Nadir Sharif
smiled and looked up at the moon. &quot;But as far as I know, you're here
entirely by coincidence. I cannot be responsible for anything that happens to
you, or anyone you see. This is merely the hand of chance. Please try to understand.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What do you mean?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I will see you in two days, Ambassador. Enjoy your
rest.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Nadir Sharif bowed, and in moments he and the Rajputs had
melted into the moonlight.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth watched them leave with a mounting sense of
disquiet. Then he turned and peered past the hooded figure, who stood waiting.
The mosque looked empty, a cavern of flickering shadows against intricate
plaster calligraphy. He unbuckled the sheath of his sword and passed it to the
man as he kicked away his loose slippers. The man took the sword without a
word, examined it for a moment as though evaluating its workmanship, then
turned to lead the way.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>They moved silently across the polished stone floor, past
enormous columns that disappeared into the darkness of the vaulted space above
them. Hawksworth relished the coolness of the stones against his bare feet,
then ducked barely in time to avoid a hanging lamp, extinguished now, its
polished metalwork almost invisible against the gloom.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Ahead a lamp flickered through the dark. They passed beneath
it, then stopped at a closed door at the rear of the mosque. The man spoke a
word Hawksworth did not understand and the door was swung open from the inside,
revealing an illuminated passageway.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Four men were waiting. As Hawksworth and his guide passed
through, the door closed behind them and the men silently drew around.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The passageway was long, freshly plastered, and floored in
marble mosaic. It was cool, as though immune from the heat of the day, and
scented faintly with rose incense that had been blended with the oil in the
hanging lamps.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>At the end of the corridor was another stairway, again of
white marble, and as they moved up its steps the man who had greeted Hawksworth
extinguished his lamp with a brass cup he carried.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Beyond the stair was another corridor, then another
door that opened as they approached. Hawksworth realized they were in an upper
story of a large building directly behind the mosque. They passed through the
door and emerged into a room facing a balcony that overlooked the abandoned
square below.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>In the center of the room was a raised dais, covered with a
thick Persian carpet. The man who had been Hawksworth's guide moved to the
dais, mounted it, and seated himself. With a flourish he dropped his white hood
and the wrap that had been around him. Hawksworth realized with a shock that
his long white hair streamed to his waist. He was naked save for a loincloth.
He gestured for Hawksworth to sit, indicating a bolster.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Welcome, English.&quot; He waited until the surprise
had registered in Hawksworth's face. &quot;We've been expecting you, but not
quite so soon.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Who are you?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I was once a Persian.&quot; He smiled. &quot;But I've
almost forgotten my country's manners. First I should offer you some
refreshment, and only then turn to affairs. Normally I would offer <i>sharbat</i>,
but I understand you prefer wine?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth stared at him speechless. No pious Muslim would
drink wine. That much he knew.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Don't look so surprised. We Persian poets often drink
wine    . . . for divine inspiration.&quot; He laughed broadly. &quot;At least
that's our  excuse. Perhaps Allah will forgive us. ‘A garden of flowers, a cup
of wine, Mark the repose of a joyous mind.’&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He signaled one of the men, and a chalice of wine appeared,
seemingly from nowhere. &quot;I once learned a Latin expression,'in vino
Veritas.&quot; As a Christian you must know it. 'In wine there is truth.' Have
some wine and we will search for truth together.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Let's start with some truth from you. How do you know
so much about me? And you still haven't told me who you are.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Who am I? You know, that's the most important question
you can ask any man. Let us say I am one who has forsworn everything the world
would have . . . and thereby found the one thing most others have lost.&quot;
He smiled easily. &quot;Can you guess what that is?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Tell me.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;My own freedom. To make verse, to drink wine, to love.
I have nothing now that can be taken away, so I live without fear. I am a
Muslim reviled by the mullahs, a poet denounced by the Moghul’s court
versifiers, a teacher rejected by those who no longer care to learn. I live
here because there is no othe</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>r
 place</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> I can be. Perhaps
I soon will be gone, but right here, right now, I am free. Because I bear
nothing but love for those who would harm me.&quot; He stared out over the
balcony for a moment in silence. &quot;Show me the man who lives in fear of
death, and I will show you one already dead in his soul. Show me the man who
knows hate, and I will show you one who can never truly know love.&quot; He
paused again and once more the room grew heavy with silence. &quot;Love,
English, love is the sweetness of desert honey. It is life itself. But you, I
think, have yet to know its taste. Because you are a slave to your own
striving. But until you give all else over, as I have done, you can never truly
know love.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;How do you think you know so much about me? I know
nothing about you. Or about why I'm here.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But I think you've heard of me.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth stared at him for a moment, and suddenly
everything came together. He could have shouted his realization.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You're Samad. The Sufi. . . .&quot; He stopped, his
heart racing. &quot;Where is . . .?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Yes, I'm a poet, and I'm called a Sufi because there is
nothing else to call me.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You're not really a Sufi?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Who knows what a Sufi is, my English friend? Not even a
Sufi knows. Sufis do not teach beliefs. They merely ask that you know who you
are.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I thought they're supposed to be mystics, like some of
the Spanish Catholics.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Mystics yearn to merge with God. To find that part
within us all that is God. Sufis teach methods for clearing away the clutter
that obscures our knowledge of who we are So perhaps we're mystics. But we're
not beloved by the mullahs.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Why not? Sufis are Muslims.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Because Sufis ignore them. The mullahs say we must
guide our lives by the Laws of the Prophet, but Sufis know God can only be
reached through love. A pure life counts for nothing if the heart is impure.
Prayers five times a day are empty words if there is no love.&quot; Samad
paused again, and then spoke slowly and quietly. &quot;I am trying to decide if
then is love about you, English.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You seem to think you know a lot about me. There's only
one person who wanted me to meet you. And she was in Surat. Where is she now?
Is she here?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;She's no longer in Surat. Be sure of that. But at this
moment you are here with me. Why always seek after what you do not have? You
see, I do know much about you. You're a pilgrim.&quot; He waved his hand
absently. &quot;But then we all are pilgrims. All searching for something. We
call it different names—fulfillment, knowledge, beauty, God. But you still have
not found what you seek, is that not true?' Samad watched Hawksworth in silence
as he drank from his own wineglass. &quot;Yes, it is given many names, but it
is in fact only one thing. We are all searching, my English, for our own self.
But the self is not easy to find, so we travel afar, hoping it lies elsewhere.
Searching inward in a much more difficult journey.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth started to speak, but Samad silenced him with a
wave of the hand. &quot;Know that you will find the thing you most want only
when you cease to search. Only then can you listen to the quiet of the heart,
only then can you find true content.&quot; Samad drank again from his wine.
&quot;This last week you have found, so you think, your fortune. You have
received worldly honors from the Moghul, you have news of imminent success for
your English king. But these things will only bring you despair in the
end.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I don't understand what you mean.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Samad laughed and finished off his glass. &quot;Then let me
tell</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>you a story
about myself, English. I was born a Persian Jew, a merchant at my birth by
historic family vocation. But my people have ignored the greatest Prophet of
all, the Prophet Mohammed. His voice invites all, and I heard that voice. I
became Muslim, but still I was a merchant. A Persian merchant. And, perhaps not
unlike you, I traveled to India search of . . . not the greater Prophet, but
the baser profit. And here, my English, I found the other thing I searched
for.  I found love. Pure love, consuming love. The kind of love few men are
privileged to know. The love of a boy whose beauty and purity could only have
come from God. But this love was mistaken by the world, was called impure, and
he was hidden from me. So the only one left for me to love was God. Thus I cast
away my garments, my worldliness, and gave myself to Him. And once more I was
misunderstood.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Samad paused and called for another glass of wine. Then he
turned back to Hawksworth. &quot;So I have told the world my story in verse.
And now there are many who understand. Not the mullahs, but the people. I have
given them words that could only come from a pure heart, words of joy that all
men can share.&quot; Samad stopped and smiled. &quot;You know we Persians are
born poets. It's said we changed Sufism from mystic speculation to mystic art.
All I know is the great poets of Persia found in Sufism a vehicle for their art
that gave back to Islam almost more than it took. But then a poet's vocation
must always be to give. I have given the people of India my heart, and they
have loved me in return. Yet such love engenders envy in the minds of men who
know it not. The Shi'ite mullahs would have condemned me for heresy long ago
were it not for one man, a man who has understood and protected me. The only
man in India who is not afraid of he Persian Shi'ites at court. And now he too
is gone. With him went my life.&quot; </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And who was that?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Can you not guess? You have already met him.&quot;
Samad smiled. &quot;Prince Jadar.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth suddenly felt as though the world had closed about
him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Why did you contrive to get me here tonight?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Because I wished to see you. And I can no longer walk
abroad. It has been forbidden on pain of death. But death is something I am
almost ready to welcome. One day soon I will walk the streets of Agra once
more, for the last time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth wondered if the claim was bravado, or truth.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But why did you want to see me?&quot; Hawksworth
studied Samad closely. Suddenly he decided to ask the question directly.
&quot;To ask me to help Jadar? You can tell him for me that I want no part of
his politics. I'm here to get a trade agreement, a <i>firman</i>. That's my
mission, why I was sent.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Samad settled his wineglass on the carpet with a sigh of
resignation. &quot;You've heard nothing I have said. I am telling you it would
be best for you to forget about your 'mission.’ Your destiny is no longer in
your hands. But if you will open your heart, you will find it has riches to
compensate you manyfold. Still, they can be yours only if you can know love.
But now, I fear, the only love you know is self-love, ambition. You have not
yet understood it is empty as mirror.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

now but several men had entered. Few of them seemed to understand Samad's
Turki.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;So what do I do now?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Stay with us for a while. Learn to know yourself.&quot;
Samad rose and stepped off the dais. &quot;Perhaps then you will at last find
what you want.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He motioned for Hawksworth to walk with him to the balcony.
Across the courtyard a single lamp burned in the turret of one of the
buildings. &quot;Tonight must be remembered as a dream, my English. And like a
dream, it is to be recalled on waking as mere light and shadow.&quot; He turned
and led Hawksworth to the door. The men stood aside for them. “And now I bid
you farewell. Others will attend you.&quot; </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>        The
night sky above the courtyard was afire, an overturned jewel box strewn about
an ivory moon. They passed through a gateway of carved columns and ornate
brackets, into a smaller plaza. The mosque was left behind: around them low
were empty pavilions, several stories high, decorated with whimsical carvings,
railings, cornices. Now they were alone in the abandoned palace, surrounded by
silence and moonlight. Only then did she speak, her voice opening through the
stillness.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I promised to think of you, and I have, more than you
can know. Tonight I want to share this with you. The private palace of the
Great Akman. The most beautiful place in all India.&quot; She paused and
pointed to a wide marble pond in the middle of the plaza. In its center was a
platform, surrounded by a railing and joined to the banks by delicate bridges.
“They say when Akman's court musician, the revered Tansen, sat there and sang a
raga for the rainy season, the clouds themselves would come to listen, and
bless the earth with their tears. Once all this was covered by one magnificent
canopy. Tonight we have only the stars.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;How did you arrange this?&quot; He still was lost in
astonishment.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Don't ask me to tell you now. Can we just share this
moment?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She took his arm and motioned ahead. There, glistening in the
moonlight, were the open arcades of a palace pavilion. I've prepared something
especially for us.&quot; She guided him through a wide-open archway and into a
large arcade, illuminated by a single oil lamp atop a stone table. In front of
them, on the walls, were brilliantly colored renderings of elephants, horses,
birds. She picked up the lamp and led him past the paintings and into the next
room, a vast red chamber whose floor was a fragrant standing pool of water. In
the flickering light he could see a marble stairway leading to a red sandstone
platform projecting out over the water, supported by square stone columns
topped by ornate brackets.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;This is where Akman spent the hot summer nights. Up
there, on the platform, above a cooling pool of rosewater. From there he would
summon his women to come to him from the <i>zenana</i>.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth dipped his fingers into the water and brought it
to his lips. It was like perfume. He turned to he and she smiled.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Yes, the Sufis still keep rosewater here, in memory of
Akman.&quot; She urged him forward, up the stairs. &quot;Come and together
we'll try to imagine how it must have felt to be the Great Moghul of
India.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As they emerged onto the platform, the vaulted ceiling above
them glowed a ruby red from the lamp. Under their feet was a thick carpet,
strewn with small velvet bolsters. At the farthest edge was a large sleeping
couch, fashioned from red marble, its dark velvet canopy held aloft by four
finely worked stone columns. The covering of the couch was a patterned blue
velvet, bordered in gold lace.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Just for tonight I've made this room like it was when
Akman slept here, with his chosen from the <i>zenana</i>.&quot; She slipped the
gauze wrap from her shoulders. He looked at her dark hair, secured with a
transparent scarf and a strand of pearls, and realized it contrasted perfectly
with the green emerald brooch that swung gently against her forehead. She wore
a necklace of pearl strands and about each upper arm was a band ringed with
pearl drops. Her eyes and eyebrows were painted dark with kohl and her lips
were a brilliant red</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Without a word she took a garland of yellow flowers from the
bed and gently slipped it over his head. Next to the couch was a round rosewood
table holding several small brass vials of perfume and incense. &quot;Tonight
this room is like a bridal chamber. For us.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>A second garland of flowers lay on the bed next to the one
she had taken. Without thinking, he reached and took it and slipped it around
her neck. Then he drew his fingertips slowly down her arm, sending a small
shiver through them both. Seeing her in the lamplight, he realized again how he
had ached for her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;A wedding? For us?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Not a wedding. Can we just call it a new beginning? The
end of one journey and the beginning of another.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth heard a sudden rustling behind him and then a
sound. He turned and searched the gloom, where two eyes peered out of the
darkness, reflecting the lamplight. He was reaching for his pistol when she
stopped his arm.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That's one of the little green parrots who live here.
They've never been harmed, and they've never been caged. So they're
unafraid.&quot; She turned and called to it. &quot;If they're caught and
imprisoned, their spirit dies and their beauty starts to fade.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The bird ruffled its wings again and flew to the top of the
bolster beside Shirin. Hawksworth watched her for a moment, still incredulous,
then settled himself on the carpet next to a chalice of wine that sat waiting.
She reached and touched his arm. &quot;I never asked you what your lovers call
you. You're so important, nobody in India knows your first name, just your
titles.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;My only other name is Brian.&quot; He found her touch
had already begun to stir him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Brian. Will you tell me everything about you, what you
like and what you don't?&quot; She began to pour the wine for them. &quot;Did I
ever tell you what I like most about you?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;In Surat you said you liked the fact I was a European.
Who always had to be master of worldly things.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, I've thought about you a lot since then.&quot;
Her expression grew pensive. &quot;I've decided it's not so simple. There's a
directness about you, and an openness, an honesty, that's very appealing.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That's European. We're not very good at intrigue. What
we're thinking always shows on our face.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She laughed. &quot;And I think I know what you're thinking
right now. But let me finish. I feel I must tell you this. There's something
else about you that may also be European, but think it's just your special
quality. You're always ready to watch and learn from what you see. Looking for
new things and new ideas. Is that also European?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I think it probably is.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It's rare here. Most Indians think everything they have
and everything they do is absolutely perfect, exactly the way it is. They might
take something foreign and use it, or copy it but they always have to appear
disdainful of anything not Indian.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You're right. I'm always being told everything here is
better.&quot; He reached for her. &quot;Sometimes it's even true.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Won't you let me tell you the rest?&quot; She took his
hand and held it. &quot;I also think you have more concern for those around you
than most Indians do. You respect the dignity of others, regardless of their
station, something you'll seldom see here, particularly among the high castes.
And there's a kindness about you too. I feel it when you're with me.&quot; She
laughed again. &quot;You know, it's a tragic thing about Muslim men. They claim
to honor women; they write poems to their beauty; but I don't think they could
ever truly love a woman. They believe she's a willful thing whom it's their
duty to contain.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She paused, then continued. &quot;But you're so very
different. It's hard to comprehend you sometimes. You love your European music,
but now I think you're starting to understand and love the music of India. I
even heard you're learning the sitar. You're sensitive to all beauty, almost
the way Samad is. It makes me feel very comfortable with you. But you're also a
lot like Prince Jadar. You're not afraid of risks. You guide your own destiny.
Instead of just accepting whatever happens, the way most Indians do.&quot; She smiled
and traced her fingers down his chest. &quot;That part makes you very
exciting.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She hesitated again. &quot;And do you know what I like least
about you? It's the <i>feringhi </i>clothes you wear.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He burst into laughter. &quot;Tell me why.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;They're so . . . undignified. When I first saw you,
that night you came to Mukarrab Khan's palace, I couldn't believe you could be
anyone of importance. Then the next morning, at the observatory, you looked
like a nobleman. Tonight, you're dressed like a <i>feringhi </i>again.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I like boots and a leather jerkin. When I'm wearing a
fancy doublet and hose, then I feel I have to be false, false as the clothes.
And when I dress like a Moghul, I always wonder if people think I'm trying to
be something I'm not.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;All right.&quot; She smiled resignedly. &quot;But perhaps
sometime tonight you'll at least take off your leather jerkin. I would enjoy
seeing you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He looked at her in wonderment. &quot;I still don't
understand you at all. You once said you thought I was powerful. But you seem
to be pretty powerful yourself. Nobody I know could force Mukarrab Khan or
Nadir Sharif to do anything. Yet you made the governor divorce you, and then
you made the prime minister deceive half of Agra to arrange this. You're so
many different things.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Don't forget. Sometimes I'm also a woman.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She rose and began to slowly draw out the long cinch holding
the waist of her wrap. Her halter seemed to trouble her as she tried to loosen
it. She laughed at her own awkwardness, and then it too came away. She was left
with only her jewels and the long scarf over her hair, which she did not
remove. Then she turned to him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Do you still remember our last night in Surat?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Do you?&quot; He looked at her in the dim lamplight.
The line of her body was flawless, with gently rounded breasts, perfect thighs,
legs lithe yet strong.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I remember what I felt when I kissed you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He laughed and moved to take her in his arms. &quot;But I
thought I was the one who kissed you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Maybe we should try it once more and decide.&quot; With
a mischievous look she caught his arms and wrapped herself around him. As he
touched her lips, she turned abruptly and the world suddenly seemed to twist
crazily around them, sending his head spinning. In shock he opened his mouth to
speak and it was flooded with the essence of rose.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The pool beneath the platform had broken their fall. He came
up gasping and found her lips.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She tasted of another world. Sweet, fragrant. He enclosed her
slowly in his arms, clasping her lean body gently at first; then feeling more
and more of her warmth he pressed her to him, both of them still gasping. They
seemed to float, weightless, serene in the darkness. Awkwardly he began pulling
away his wet jerkin.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You're just as I imagined.&quot; Her hands traveled
across his chest, lightly caressing his skin, while the lamp flickered against
the paintings on the walls above them. &quot;There's a strength about you, a
roughness.&quot; She nuzzled his chest with her face. &quot;Tonight will you
let me be your poet?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Tonight you can be anything you want.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I want to sing of you—a man I adore—of the desire I
feel for you. After we know each other fully, the great longing will be gone.
The most intense moment we can ever share will be past. The ache of
wanting.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What you just said reminds me of something John Donne
once wrote.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Who is he?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;One of our English poets and songwriters. But he had a
slightly different idea.&quot; He hesitated, then smiled. &quot;To tell the
truth, I think I may like his better.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She lifted herself up in the water, rose petals patterned
across her body. &quot;Then tell me what he said.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It's the only poem of his I can still remember, but
only the first verse. For some reason I'll never forget it. I sometimes think
of it when I think of you. Let me say it in English first and then try to
translate.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

translation, awkward and halting. Then she was silent for a moment, floating
her hand across the surface of the pond.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You know, I also wonder now what I did before I met
you. Before I held you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She slipped her hands about his neck, and as she did he drew
her up out of the water and cradled her against him. Then he lifted her, her
body still strewn with rose petals, and carried her slowly up the marble stairs
to the couch of Akman. He felt her cling to him like no woman ever had, and as
he placed her on the bed, she took his face in her hands and kissed him for a
long moment. Then he heard her whisper.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Tonight we will know just each other. And there will be
nothing else.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>And they gave each to each until there was nothing more to
give because each was the other. Together, complete.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He was on the quarterdeck, the whipstaff aching against his
hand, the mainsail furled as storm winds lashed the waist of the ship with wave
after powerful wave. The ship was the <i>Queen's Hope</i>, his vessel when he
sailed for the Levant Company, and the rocks that towered off his starboard bow
were Gibraltar. He shouted into the dark for the quartermaster to reef the
tops'ls, and he leaned on the whipstaff to bring her about, but neither
responded. He had no crew. He was being swept, helpless, toward the empty
darkness that lay ahead. Another wave caught him across the face, and somewhere
in the dark came a screech, as though the sea had given up some dying Leviathan
beast. His seaboots were losing their hold on the quarterdeck, and now the
whipstaff had grown sharp talons that cut into his hand. Then a woman's voice,
a distant siren calling him. Again the screech and then yet another wave cut
across his face.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The water tasted of roses. . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He jerked violently awake. On his hand a green parrot was
perched, preening itself and ruffling its feathers. And from the pool below
Shirin was flinging handfuls of water up over the side of the platform,
laughing as she tried to splash his face.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She was floating, naked, below him, her hair streaming out
across the surface of the water, tangled among the drifting rose petals. He
looked about and saw his own wet clothes, mingled among her silks and jewels.
For a moment he felt again the terror of the dream, the rudderless ship
impelled by something beyond control, and then he caught the edge of the
platform and slipped over the side.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The water was cool against his skin and involuntarily he
caught his breath. Then he reached out and wrapped her in his arms, pulling her
against him. She turned her face to his, twined her hair around his head, and
crushed his lips with her own. Just as suddenly, she threw back her head and
laughed with joy. He found himself laughing with her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Why don't we both just stay? I don't have to be back in
Agra until the wedding. We could have a week.&quot; He studied the perfect
lines of her face, the dark eyes at once defiant and anxious, and wished he
could hold her forever. The Worshipful East India Company be damned.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But we both have things we must do.&quot; She revolved
in the flowered water and drew her face above his. She kissed him again,
languorously. Then she drew herself out of the water and twisted a wrap around
her, covering her breasts. &quot;Both you and I.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And what's this thing you have to do?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Her eyes shadowed. &quot;One thing I must try to do is
convince Samad he cannot stay here any longer. He has to go south, where Prince
Jadar can protect him. But he refuses to listen. And time is growing short now.
I truly fear for what may happen to him after the wedding. The Persian Shi'ite
mullahs will certainly be powerful enough then to demand he be tried and
executed on charges of heresy. For violating some obscure precept of Islamic
law. It will be the end for him.&quot; She paused. &quot;And for anyone who has
helped him.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then if he won't leave, at least you should.&quot; He
lifted himself out of the water and settled beside her on the marble paving.
&quot;Why don't you come back to England with me? When the fleet from Bantam
makes landfall at Surat, Arangbar will surely have the courage to sign the <i>firman</i>,
and then my mission will be finished. It should only be a matter of weeks,
regardless of what the Portugals try to do.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She studied the water of the pool with sadness in her eyes
and said nothing for a moment as she kicked the surface lightly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Neither of us is master of what will happen. Things are
going to soon be out of control. For both of us. Things are going to happen
that you will not understand.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth squinted through the half-light. &quot;What's
going to happen?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Who can know? But I would not be surprised to see the
prince betrayed totally, in one final act that will eventually destroy him. He
is too isolated. Too weak. And when that happens we're all doomed. Even you,
though I don't think you'll believe that now.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Why should I? I'm not betting on Prince Jadar. I agree
with you. I don't think he has a chance. I'm betting on a <i>firman </i>from
Arangbar, and soon.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You'll never get a <i>firman </i>from the Moghul. And
Arangbar will be gone in half a year. The queen has already started appearing
at morning <i>darshan </i>and directing his decisions at afternoon <i>durbar</i>.
As soon as she has Allaudin under her control, Arangbar will be finished. Mark
it. He'll die from too much opium, or from some mysterious poison or accident.
He will cease to exist, to matter.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I don't believe it. He seems pretty well in
control.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;If that's what you think, then you are very deceived.
He can't live much longer. Everyone knows it. Perhaps even he knows it in his
heart. Soon he will give up even the appearance of rule. Then the queen will
take full command of the Imperial army, and Prince Jadar will be hunted down
like a wild boar.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He studied her, not sure he could reasonable contradict her,
and felt his stomach knot. &quot;What will happen to you, if the queen takes
over?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I don't know. But I do know I love you. I truly do. How</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>sad it makes
me that I can't tell you everything.&quot; Her eyes darkened and she took his
hand. &quot;Please understand I did not know the prince would use you the way
he has. But it is for good. Try to believe that.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What do you mean?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She hesitated and looked away. &quot;Let me ask you this.
What do you think the prince will do after the wedding?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I don't know, but I think he'd be very wise to keep
clear of Agra. Nobody at court will even talk about him now, at least not
openly. Still, I think he might be able to stay alive if he's careful. If he
survives the campaign in the Deccan, maybe he can bargain something out of the
queen. But I agree with you about one thing. She can finish him any time she
wants. I understand she already has de facto control of the Imperial army, in
Arangbar's name of course. What can Jadar do? He's outnumbered beyond any
reasonable odds. Maybe she'll make him a governor in the south if he doesn't
challenge her.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Do you really believe he'd accept that? Can't you see
that's impossible? You've met Prince Jadar. Do you think he'll just give up?
That's the one thing he'll never do. He has a son now. The people will support
him.&quot; She pulled herself next to him. &quot;I feel so isolated and
hopeless just thinking about it all. I'm so glad Nadir Sharif brought you
here.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He slipped his arm around her. &quot;So am I. Will you tell
me now how you managed to make him do it?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I still have friends left in Agra.&quot; She smiled.
&quot;And Nadir Sharif still has a few indiscretions he'd like kept buried.
Sometimes he can be persuaded . . .&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Did he know Samad was here?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;If he didn't before, he does now. But he won't say
anything. Anyway, it hardly matters any more. The queen probably already knows
Samad's here.&quot; She sighed. &quot;The worst is still waiting. For him. And
for both of us.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He caught a handful of water and splashed it against her
thigh. &quot;Then let's not talk about it. Until tomorrow.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The worry in her eyes seemed to dissolve and she laughed.
&quot;Do you realize how much you've changed since I first met you? You were as
stiff as a Portuguese Jesuit then, before Kali and Kamala got their painted
fingernails into you. Kali, the lover of the flesh, and Kamala, the lover of
the spirit.&quot; She glared momentarily. &quot;Now I must take care, lest you
start comparing me with them. Never forget. I'm different. I believe love
should be both.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He pulled her away and looked at her face. &quot;I'm amazed
by how different you are. I still have no idea what you're really like. What
you really think.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;About what?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Anything. Everything.&quot; He shrugged. &quot;About
this even.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You mean being here with you? Making love with
you?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That's a perfect place to start.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She smiled and eased back in the water, silently toying for a
moment with the rose petals drifting around her. &quot;I think making love with
someone is how we share our deepest feelings. Things we can't express any other
way. It's how I tell you my love for you.&quot; She paused. &quot;The way music
or poetry reveal the soul of the one who creates them.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Are you saying you think lovemaking is like creating
music?&quot; He examined her, puzzling.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;They both express what we feel inside.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He lifted up a handful of water and watched it trickle back
into the pool. &quot;I've never thought of it quite like that before.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Why not? It's true. Before you can create music, you
have to teach both your body and your heart. It's the same with making
love.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What do you mean?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She reached and touched his thigh. &quot;When we're very
young, lovemaking is mostly just desire. We may think it's more, but it isn't
really. Then gradually we learn more of its ways, how to give and receive. But
even then we still don't fully understand its deeper significance. We're like a
novice who has learned the techniques of the sitar, the way to strike and pull
a string to make one note blend into another, but who still doesn't comprehend
the spiritual depth of a raga. Its power to move our heart. We still don't
understand that its meaning and feeling can only come from within. And love,
like a raga, is an expression of reverence and of wonder. Wonder at what we are
and can be. So even after all the techniques are mastered, we still must learn
to experience this wonder, this sense of our spirit becoming one with the
other. Otherwise it's somehow still empty. Like perfect music that has no
feeling, no life.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He was silent for a moment, trying to comprehend what she was
saying. &quot;If you look at it like that, I suppose you could be right.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;With music, we first have to learn its language, then
learn to open our spirit. Lovemaking is just the same.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She nestled her head against his chest, sending her warmth
through him. As he held her, he noticed lying alongside the pool the garland of
flowers she had worn the night before. He reached and took it and slipped it
over her head. Then he kissed her gently, finding he was indeed filled with
wonder at the feeling he had for her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He held her silently for a time, looking at the paintings on
the walls of the palace around them. Then he noticed a large straw basket at
the entryway.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What is that?&quot; He pointed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She rose and looked. &quot;I think it's something Samad had
left for us.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She lifted herself out of the water and, holding her wrap
against her, brought the basket. It was filled with fruits and melons.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;They're not from Samarkand or Kabul, like you've
probably grown accustomed to at the palace in Agra. But I think you'll like
them anyway.&quot; She squinted across the square, in the direction of the
mosque. &quot;I love Samad dearly. He did all of this for me. But he refuses to
listen to anything I say.&quot; She handed him an apple, then reached and took
some grapes. &quot;You know, I think he secretly wants to die a martyr. Like a
lover eager to die for his or her beloved. He wants to die for his wild
freedom, for what he thinks is beautiful. Perhaps to be remembered as one who
never bowed to anyone. I wish I had his strength.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Where's he now?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You won't see him any more. But he's still here. He'll
have food sent to us. He loves me like a daughter, and he's happy when I am.
And he knows now you make me happy. But you mustn't see him here again, even
know that he's here. It would be too dangerous for you. Perhaps someday, if
we're all still alive.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He took her face in his hands and held it up to him.
&quot;You have as much strength as anyone, including Samad. And I want to get
you away from here before your strength makes you do something foolish. I love
you more than my own life.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And I love you. Like I've never loved anyone.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Not even the Great Moghul? When you were in his <i>zenana</i>?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She laughed. &quot;You know that was very different. I was
scarcely more than a girl then. I didn't know anything.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You learned a few things somewhere.&quot; He remembered
the night past, still astonished. The way she had . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;In the <i>zenana </i>you learn everything about
lovemaking. But nothing about love.&quot; She rose and took his hand. Together
they walked to the open portico of the palace. Around them the red pavilions
were empty in the early sunshine. The morning was still, save for the cries of
the green parrots who scurried across eaves and peered down impassively from
weathered red railings and banisters. His gaze followed the wide arches, then
turned to her dark shining hair. He reached out and stroked it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Tell me more about it. How did you learn Turki?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;In the <i>zenana</i>. We had to learn it, even though
Arangbar speaks perfect Persian.&quot; She turned to him. &quot;And how did you
learn to understand it?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;In a Turkish prison.&quot; He laughed. &quot;It seems
about the same to me. I had to learn it too.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Will you tell me about it? Why were you in
prison?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Like you, I had no choice. The Turks took a ship I was
commanding, in the Mediterranean.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Tell me what happened.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He stopped and looked at her. &quot;All right. We'll trade.
You tell me all about you and I'll tell you everything about me. We'll leave
out nothing. Agreed?&quot; She reached and kissed him. &quot;Will you begin
first?&quot;</span></p>

<h2><a name=bookmark25><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO</span></a></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>       The
imminent wedding of Prince Allaudin and Princess Layla was a momentous event in
the history of the Moghul empire. It represented the final merging of two
dynasties. One, that of the Moghul Akman and his first son Arangbar, was in
direct assent from the Mongols of the steppes who had conquered India by the
sword less than a century before, melding under one rule a disorganized array
of Muslim and Hindu states. The other dynasty, that of Queen Janahara, her
Persian father Zainul Beg, her brother Nadir Sharif, and now her daughter
Layla, represented a very different kind of conqueror. At court they were
called, always in whispers, the &quot;Persian junta.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Whereas no combination of forces indigenous to India—even the
recalcitrant Rajput warrior chieftains of the northwest—had ever succeeded in
wresting power from the invading Moghuls, this extraordinary Persian family
had, in one generation, come to rule India virtually as equals with the dynasty
of Akman, assuming the power that the decadent Arangbar had let slowly slip
away. With the marriage of Queen Janahara's daughter to the weakling son of
Arangbar, a son she was carefully promoting to the role of heir-apparent, the
last element in the Persian strategy would be in place. When Arangbar died, or
was dethroned, the powerful line of Akman, who had unified India by a blend of force
and diplomatic marriages, would be supplanted by what was, in effect, a palace
coup. The &quot;Persian junta&quot; would have positioned itself to assume
effective control of India: Prince Allaudin, for so long as he was allowed to
maintain even the appearance of rule, would be nothing more than a titular
sovereign. Queen Janahara, together with her father and her brother, would be
the real ruler of India.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The queen could, of course, have contented herself for a time
longer merely to direct Arangbar from beside the throne, but that could never
be entirely satisfactory. Arangbar still wielded power when he so chose, and
that power could be enormous.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>India had no independent judiciary, no parliament, no
constitution. There was, instead and only, the word of the Moghul. Criminals
were brought before him to be tried and sentenced. Offices of state were
filled, or vacated, on his personal whim. The army marched at his word. And he
owned, in effect, a large part of Indian soil, since large estates went not to
heirs but returned to the Moghul when their current &quot;owner&quot; died. He
granted lands and salaries as reward for loyalty and service. And he alone
granted titles. Seldom in history had a land so vast, and a people so diverse,
been held so absolutely under the unquestioned rule of a single hand. Queen
Janahara now looked confidently forward to the day that hand would be hers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The power Arangbar now possessed was thought by many to have
brought his own undoing. Originally an introspective if sometimes whimsical
sovereign—whose early memoirs were filled with scientific observations on
India's fauna and flora, and statesman-like ruminations on the philosophy of
governing—he had become slowly dissolute to the point of incapacity. A man who
had forsworn both alcohol and drugs until well into his third decade of life,
he was now hopelessly addicted to both. In consequence his judgment and
instincts had grown ever more unreliable. And since all appointments of salary
and place depended on his word alone, no career or fortune was truly secure. It
was into this vacuum of sound leadership that the &quot;Persian junta&quot; of
Janahara's family had moved.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The Persian junta was supported by all those at court who
feared Arangbar's growing caprice, by other influential Persians, by the
powerful mullahs of the Shi'ite sect of Islam, by Hindus who still habored
historic grievances against Moghul rule . . . and by the Portuguese. The
&quot;Persian junta&quot; was not loved. But it did not need to be loved; it
enjoyed an even more compelling ingredient for success: it was feared. Even
those who might have preferred the succession of Prince Jadar wisely held
silent. The tides of history were there for all to see.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Even Brian Hawksworth saw them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The private palace of Zainul Beg, father of Janahara and
Nadir Sharif and grandfather of Princess Layla, was more modest than that of
Nadir Sharif, and its architecture more Persian, almost consciously reminiscent
of the land of his birth. It lay on the banks of the Jamuna River, farther down
from the palace of Nadir Sharif, and this evening it was brilliantly
illuminated by bonfires along the riverside. Even the river itself was lighted.
A dozen barks filled with lamps had been towed upriver from the Red Fort, and
now their camphor-oil flames cast a dazzling white sheen over the pink turrets
of the palace. On the opposite bank of the Jamuna, men were lighting candles
and floating them in hollow clay pots across the surface of the water, where
they drifted gently downstream toward the Red Fort, creating a line of
illumination that would eventually stretch for miles.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Although Hawksworth's money was starting to grow short, he
had used a large portion of what was left to purchase a new pair of striped
Indian trousers, an expensive brocade turban, and ornate velvet slippers. He alighted
from his palanquin at the palace gate looking like a Moghul grandee, to be
greeted almost immediately by Zainul Beg's eunuchs and ushered into the main
hall. As he entered, the eunuchs directed him toward a large silver fish
stationed by the door. It was ornamented with green lapis lazuli scales and
fitted with seven spouts shooting thin streams of rosewater outward into a
large basin. Hawksworth was by now accustomed to this Moghul ritual, and he
quickly removed his new slippers and splashed his feet in the basin to the
minimal extent acceptable. Then he turned and made his way through the line of
nobles reverently awaiting the arrival of Arangbar. He had become such a
familiar sight at royal gatherings that his presence excited no unusual notice.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The marble walls of the hall were hung with new Persian
tapestries and the floors covered with silk carpets embroidered with silver and
gold. At the corners were immense vases of solid gold studded with precious
stones that sparkled in the lamp light. Incense burners wrought from silver
hung from the walls. Servants circulated among the crowd bearing trays of
rolled betel leaves, glasses of lemony <i>sharbat</i>, and cups of green milky <i>bhang</i>.
In deference to the ceremonial significance of this holy Muslim occasion, there
would be no wine until after the Shi'ite mullahs had left. Hawksworth decided
to take a glass of <i>sharbat </i>and wait for the wine.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He strolled through the buzzing crowd of bejeweled men and
anonymous, veiled women and reflected on the bizarre ceremonies of a Moghul
marriage.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>His first taste had come only the previous evening, when he
had been invited to the Red Fort to witness and take part in the henna <i>bandi
</i>ceremony. The square just below the <i>Diwan-i-Khas</i>, where Arangbar's
birthday weighing was held only two weeks before, had been cleared and made
ready for the henna ceremony. Hawksworth had arrived and been granted a place
near Nadir Sharif and Arangbar. The crowd was already being entertained by
music and dancing women. Allaudin was there, slightly nervous in anticipation
of his upcoming ordeal.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then the procession arrived: women of the <i>zenana </i>rode
into the courtyard on palanquins, in a flower-bedecked line bearing henna—a red
paste extracted from the plant of the same name—and gifts sent from Layla to
Allaudin. The bride was not present; she had not yet been seen by Allaudin or
any of his family, including Arangbar. The women of the <i>zenana</i>, all
veiled, spread before the Moghul the gifts that, on this night, the bride was
expected to present to the bridegroom. The eunuchs bore trays which had been
covered with basketwork raised in domes, over which were thrown draperies of
gold cloth and brocade in a rainbow of colors. They were brought before
Allaudin and Arangbar and uncovered one by one. The first tray was of beaten
silver and it held a new suit for the bridegroom, a tailored cloak and trousers
woven with strands of gold. Others bore gold and silver vessels containing
cosmetics and toiletries—collyrium, kohl, musky perfumes—and plates of sweets,
betel leaves tied with strings of gold, and a confectionary of dried fruits and
preserves. The eunuchs also brought in sprays of flowers containing disguised
fireworks wheels, which were ignited as they entered to create a startling,
fiery garden of color.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Next the women led Allaudin to rooms behind the <i>Diwan-i-Khas</i>,
where he was dressed in the new clothes provided for him by the bride. Bamboo
slats were placed across the doorway to enable the <i>zenana </i>women to watch
the ceremony. While he was gone, an opening was prepared in the screen
separating the <i>zenana </i>from the courtyard and a low stool was placed just
outside. The screen was specially constructed to allow the hands and feet of
the one sitting on the stool to be reached from behind it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>When Allaudin returned, he assumed his place again beside
Arangbar, shifting occasionally in mild discomfort from the stiff new clothes.
It was obvious to Hawksworth that he wished to appear bored by the ceremonies,
but his eyes betrayed his apprehension.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then a eunuch approached and announced to the male
assembly—Arangbar, Allaudin, Nadir Sharif, Zainul Beg, and a retinue of other
men with vague ties to royal blood who were waiting at the center of the
courtyard—that &quot;the bridegroom is wanted.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Go quickly.&quot; Arangbar pushed Allaudin toward the
stool waiting in front of the screen covering the entrance to the zenana.
&quot;It's always a man's fate to be made the fool by his women.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Allaudin marched across the courtyard with as much dignity as
his stiff new clothes allowed, and seated himself with a flourish on the stool.
The air was rich with incense and music from the upper balconies. As Hawksworth
and the other male guests watched, women from behind the screen ordered
Allaudin to insert his hands and feet through the new holes. He was then teased
and fed small lumps of sugar candy while the women behind the screen began to
tie dark red cloths, soaked in a paste of moist leaves of henna, onto his hands
and feet.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;This ceremony is very important, Inglish.&quot;
Arangbar had beamed with satisfaction as he watched. &quot;Henna is a charm to
promote their union. The women anoint the bride with it also, in private. It
will make him virile and her fertile.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As the women continued to dye Allaudin's hands and feet with
the paste, musicians and singers began to entertain him. Some of the songs, all
extemporary, lauded him as a prince among men, while others rhapsodized over
the beauty of the bride. Listening to their songs, Hawksworth had to remind
himself that none of the singers had actually seen the bride, whose beauty they
now extolled as that of one woman in thousands. Then the singers sang of the
impending happiness of the pair, as inevitable, they declared, as that Paradise
awaiting Believers after life on earth is past.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>After the women had finished their task, Allaudin turned to
face the assembled men wearing a vaguely sheepish expression. Hawksworth had
caught himself laughing out loud at the preposterous figure Allaudin struck,
standing before them with hands and feet dripping red with henna.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then he noticed a group of veiled women filing out from
behind the screen and approaching. They carried a silver chalice filled with
red henna paste. The women stopped in front of Arangbar, bowed with the <i>teslim</i>,
and began to anoint his fingers with henna. Then they tied each reddened finger
with a small, goId-embroidered handkerchief. He smiled widely and signaled a
eunuch to bring him a ball of opium. Next the women proceeded to Zainul Beg and
reddened his fingers also, then Nadir Sharif, then all the other family
members. Finally they stopped in front of Hawksworth.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>A robust woman from the <i>zenana </i>seized his fingers and
began to daub them with henna paste. It was thick and smelled of saffron. He
watched helplessly as his fingers disappeared into the red, after which they
too were swathed in the small kerchiefs of silk and gold.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It will make you virile too, Inglish. This is a great
omen for your good fortune,&quot; Arangbar observed wryly, delighted by the
confused look on Hawksworth's face.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The women disappeared back into the <i>zenana </i>and the
music began again, now with more dancers. Hawksworth recognized among them the
young women Sangeeta, who had danced Kathak for Arangbar that first night in
the <i>Diwan-i-Khas</i>. She was resplendent, and her face announced her pride
in being selected for the first night of the wedding celebrations.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>After she had finished her dance, the veiled women again
emerged from the <i>zenana</i>, carrying a large silver vessel, and saluted
Allaudin. He was brought to the center of the square, where they began to
remove the red bindings on his hands and feet. His hands, then his feet, were
bathed in rosewater. After they were dried, he was taken back to the <i>Diwan-i-Khas
</i>and attired in yet another of the new suits of clothes given to him by the
bride. He returned to the general cheers of the assembled guests, whose hands
had also been washed while he was gone.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As the formal ceremonies drew to a close, Arangbar produced
heavy brocade waist sashes for all the male guests. Hawksworth was last, and
when he received his from Arangbar's hand, he bowed in thanks and examined it
quizzically.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It is a <i>kamar-band</i>, Inglish, for you to wear
tomorrow night at the wedding.&quot; Arangbar took Hawksworth's red-stained
fingers and examined them for a moment. &quot;If you can get the rest of the
henna off your fingers by then.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He roared with delight and signaled the musicians to start
again. Allaudin was escorted from the square by a number of young men in
foppish cloaks—Hawksworth assumed they were his friends—and then, as midnight
approached, servants appeared with the evening's meal.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>While the men drank and dined, Sangeeta entertained them with
more Kathak dance. When she was near exhaustion, other dancers were brought
out, and the music and dance continued undiminished through the short hours
remaining before dawn. Only when the eastern sky began to lighten did Arangbar
rise and bid the guests farewell. The courtyard cleared in moments.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As the crowd dispersed, Hawksworth watched the Moghul down
another ball of opium and call for Sangeeta to accompany him into the palace.
She was escorted by the eunuchs, her smile brighter than the rising sun.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth was momentarily startled as a fanfare of trumpets
announced to the guests in Zainul Beg's hall that Arangbar was approaching. The
center of the hall cleared, leaving a pathway from the entrance to a low
platform at the opposite end, on which were two large cushions fashioned from
gold cloth. On some unseen command musicians in an adjacent room began to play,
and then the doors of the hall opened wide.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Women from Arangbar's <i>zenana </i>entered first, sweeping
past the guests in a glitter of silks and jewels unlike anything Hawksworth had
ever seen. The women displayed heavy gold necklaces and multiple strands of
pearls. Their arms were scarcely visible beneath their wide gold bracelets. For
this evening, all wore a headdress of silver cloth and a veil.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>More trumpets sounded as Arangbar himself entered, Queen
Janahara striding imperiously behind him. Hawksworth examined her hard features
with curiosity for a moment before the significance of the scene registered.
She was not wearing a veil.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He looked about him and realized that the other guests had
noticed as well.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Nadir Sharif trailed behind the royal couple, and after him
came a few select officials of the court, including the <i>qazi </i>who would
perform the ceremony and officially record the marriage.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As Arangbar and Janahara seated themselves on the cushioned
platform, the guests all performed the <i>teslim</i>. Arangbar motioned for the
crowd to be seated, and Hawksworth was already halfway to the carpet before he
noticed that no one else had moved. Only after Arangbar had demanded three
times that the guests seat themselves did those around Hawksworth accede to his
request.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>More trays of rolled betel leaves and <i>sharbat </i>were
circulated, and the guests settled to listen to a lively raga performed on
sitar and tabla drums by musicians who were seated on a small dais at the
opposite end of the hall. The time was approaching eight o'clock when the
musicians brought the music to a rousing finish.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth found himself beginning to wonder where the bride
and groom were. They were nowhere to be seen.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>No sooner had the last notes of the raga melted into the
tapestried walls than there came a knocking at the closed doors of the hall.
There were sounds of a raucous, but not rancorous, argument. Everyone around
Hawksworth fell silent to listen. There were more words, and he managed to
grasp that the family of the bride was demanding a payment for entry, apparently
a mock ritual. Finally there was the jingle of coins dropping into a cup. The
money seemed to settle the dispute, for the doors of the hall suddenly burst
open, to the sounds of a trumpet fanfare.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth looked through the doorway to see a horse and rider,
surrounded by a milling crowd.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>In the lamplight he could see the horse was covered with a
fine brocade tapestry, into which fresh flowers had been woven. Its legs, tail,
and mane had been dyed red with henna, and all its body outside the tapestry
was covered with glistening spangles. The rider's cloak and turban were heavy
with gold thread, and his face was hidden behind a thick veil of silver cloth
attached to the top of this turban and hanging to his waist. On either side of
the horse two young men stood, each carrying a large paper umbrella, which they
held over the rider's head. Behind them clustered singers, dancers, musicians,
and a mob of tipsy young men in extravagant finery.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The crowd cheered the veiled rider and he saluted them. From
the chatter of the guests, Hawksworth gathered that the horse had led a
procession through the streets of Agra for the past two hours in preparation
for this grand entrance.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The rider, whom Hawksworth assumed to be Prince Allaudin, was
helped onto the back of one of the young men. He was then carried to the dais
where Arangbar and Janahara sat and gently lowered to the ground. The silver
veil was removed and he performed the <i>teslim</i>, the fatigue in his face
beginning to show.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Arangbar beckoned him to rise, and two eunuchs who
had been part of the Moghul’s train stepped forward and placed two large silver
boxes beside him on the dais. Arangbar opened the first and drew out a string
of large pearls. He admired them for a moment, showed them to Janahara, then
looped them around Allaudin's neck. Next he opened the other box and drew out a
crown of silver trimmed in gold. He rose to his feet and held it aloft.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Two months past I presented a <i>sachaq</i>, a marriage
present, of two <i>lakhs </i>of silver rupees to honor the bride. And tonight I
bestow on my son the same <i>sehra</i>, the same bridegroom's crown, that was
placed on my head the night I wed Her Majesty, Queen Janahara.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Allaudin slipped off his turban and knelt before Arangbar.
After the crown was fitted, he stood erect to acknowledge the cheers of the
crowd.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Without further ceremony, Arangbar turned and spoke to Zainul
Beg. The old <i>wazir </i>beckoned two eunuchs forward and passed an order.
There were shouts, and torches were lighted in the upper balcony of the hall.
Then, as Hawksworth watched in amazement, the tapestries at the far end of the
hall were drawn away, opening the pavilion to the riverfront.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Arangbar and Janahara revolved on their cushions to face the
water, which was now a sea of floating candles and lamps. The guests surged
forward toward the opening, and as Hawksworth passed near the royal dais,
Arangbar's voice cut through the din.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Inglish, come and join us. There will be no henna on
your fingers tonight.&quot; He gestured toward the carpet near his feet.
&quot;Sit here. I would have your opinion of this.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Thank you, Your Majesty.&quot; Hawksworth sensed that
Arangbar was already partly drunk. &quot;What will happen now?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Just more tradition, Inglish, but the part I always
enjoy most.&quot; He pointed toward the river, where servants were carrying
torches in the direction of three decorated wheels, each several feet across,
mounted atop what appeared to be small-gauge cannon. &quot;Tell me if your king
has anything to equal this.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As he spoke the servants touched the torches to the center of
each wheel. Lines of burning sulfur traced their spokes, then ignited the
squibs attached around their perimeter. At that instant, other servants stepped
forward and thrust a burning taper to the touchhole of each cannon. The cannon
spewed flame, lofting the wheels upward over the river. They suddenly began to
rotate, creating a whirling circle of colored flame tips in the night sky. Just
as they reached the top of their trajectory, they began to explode one by one,
showering sparks and fire across the face of the Jamuna.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The turbaned crowd scarcely had time to exclaim its delight
before a blue flame suddenly appeared from behind where the wheels had been,
illuminating the palace walls in a shimmering, ghostly light. As it grew,
Hawksworth realized it was an artificial tree whose branches were saturated
with black powder and brimstone. Next more flames spewed from the tops of five
towers that had been erected near the riverfront. There were sharp reports, as
though a musket had been fired, and dense streaks of red billowed into the sky.
All around powder pots began to explode, hurtling lightning, dazzling white
with camphor, and writhing serpents of flame into the smoky night air.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, Inglish, what do you think?' Arangbar turned to
Hawksworth with a delighted smile. &quot;Have you ever seen anything to
compare?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;We have fireworks in England too, Your
Majesty, particularly on the eve of St. John's Day, when we have barges of
fireworks on the Thames. And sometimes they're used in plays and pageants. And
at the wedding of His Majesty's daughter, four of King James's gunners gave a
show with a fiery castle, a dragon, a damsel, and St. George. But English
fireworks generally make more noise than these.&quot; Hawksworth paused,
wondering how much to tell. &quot;And some countries in Europe use fireworks in
battle, Majesty. Helmets that throw fire, swords and lances with fiery points,
and bucklers that give out flames when struck.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Arangbar gave him a puzzled glance. &quot;But what good are
those, Inglish? In battle the most important use of flame is the fire lance.
What use are sparking swords? Watch and you will see what I mean.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Arangbar pointed to a line of Rajput marksmen, carrying horn
bows and heavy spears, who had assembled at one side of the clearing. While
they fell into a formation perpendicular to the river, servants were placing
clay pots on small stands at the opposite side, perhaps seventy yards away. The
Rajputs watched impassively as the arrows in their bows were lighted, and then
on the shout of their commander they lifted their bows and fired in unison.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Ten streaks of flame shot across the riverfront, and the
crowd fell expectantly silent. All the arrows seemed to reach their target at
precisely the same instant. Each had been aimed at a separate pot, and as they
impacted, the silence was rent by what sounded like a single explosion. The
pots, Hawksworth realized, had been primed with powder, ready to detonate.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The smoke was still drifting across the grounds when torch
carriers with large flambeaux moved to the center, illuminating scaffolding
that had been hastily erected. More clay pots, painted white, hung suspended
from the scaffolds on long ropes. The servants set the pots swinging and then
fell back, while the Rajputs ignited the tips of their spears.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Again flame streaked across the clearing and again there was
a simultaneous explosion as the spears caught the swinging pots.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Arangbar joined the cheers, then turned and slapped
Hawksworth on the shoulder. &quot;That, Inglish, is how you use fire in battle.
You must put it where you want it. No soldier of India would be daunted by
trick swords and bucklers.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;My king agrees with you, Majesty. He leaves such toys
to the Germans.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The display continued for almost an hour, as one exotic
device after another was carried next to the riverfront. The water became
littered with burning paper and the air so dense with smoke that Queen Janahara
finally started to cough. Arangbar immediately ordered an end to the fireworks,
and as the crowd filed back into the hall, the tapestries were lowered to again
conceal the smoky view of the river.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Now the music began, and the dancing, as musicians and women
moved to the center of the hall. Servants circulated with more betel leaves and
<i>sharbat</i>, and Arangbar took his first ball of opium.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Hawksworth glanced guardedly at the queen. Her
manner was imperious, regal, everything a sovereign should be. Everything
Allaudin was not. And, he thought, probably a lot Arangbar himself is not.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She'll soon have India by the <i>cojones</i>, not a doubt on
it. And then it's farewell Jadar. And probably farewell Arangbar too. Will I
get a signed <i>firman </i>for trade before it's too late?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As midnight neared, the music and dance were suddenly
interrupted by trumpets and a drum roll and shouts of &quot;the bride
comes.&quot; The curtains covering a large doorway leading into the palace were
drawn open, and a closed palanquin was brought in by four eunuchs. It was
accompanied by veiled women singing something Hawksworth did not understand.
The palanquin was carried to the center of the room, where a low platform
covered with gold brocade had been positioned, and then the eunuchs lowered it
to the marble floor. The curtains were drawn aside and a veiled woman emerged,
her small body almost smothered in a dress that seemed made of multiple layers
of beaten gold. She was helped to the middle of the platform, still wearing a
veil that covered her entire face. Chants of &quot;Hail to the bride&quot;
arose on all sides.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then Allaudin was escorted forward, taking his place on the
platform beside her. He stole a quick, distasteful glance at the veiled figure
beside him, then an official smile illuminated his face and he sat patiently as
the <i>qazi </i>was summoned in front of them. The official was bearded, stern-
faced, and transparently arrogant. He stood before the veiled bride and
motioned around him for silence.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Is it by your own consent that this marriage take place
with Prince Allaudin, son of His Royal Majesty?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>From beneath the layers of the veil came a muffled,
almost hesitant, &quot;It is by my consent.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The <i>qazi </i>seemed satisfied and began reading a passage
from the Quran, informing her that marriage depends on three circumstances: the
assent of the bride and groom, the evidence of two witnesses, and the marriage
settlement. He then turned to Allaudin and asked him to name the sum he
brought.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Allaudin mumbled a figure that Hawksworth did not catch, but
then the <i>qazi </i>repeated it for the guests. Hawksworth caught his breath
when he realized the amount named was fifty <i>lakhs </i>of rupees. Then
Allaudin said something else, which the <i>qazi </i>did not repeat.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Later Hawksworth learned that Allaudin had added he was
giving only ten lakhs of rupees then, and the balance at some indefinite future
time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The <i>qazi </i>blessed the royal pair, praying that they
would be blissful in this world and in eternity, and then wrote something
quickly in a book he carried. Finally the eunuchs appeared again and assisted
the bride into the palanquin. The marriage ceremony seemed to be over.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>A glass of wine was placed in Hawksworth's hand, and he
looked up to see Arangbar beaming with satisfaction.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Now we drink, Inglish. Come, sit closer and help me
toast the bridegroom.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It was truly a royal wedding, Your Majesty.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But it's not over, Inglish.&quot; Arangbar roared with
laughter. &quot;The hardest part is yet to come. Does my son have the strength
to complete the work he's offered to undertake? No one can leave until we're
sure.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth had begun his third glass of wine when Princess
Layla reappeared, wearing a lighter dress, though still resplendent. Behind her
eunuchs carried several palanquins piled high with vessels and trays of silver.
Following them were servants bearing bundles on their heads.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Those are the wares she brings to the marriage,
Inglish, and her servants. I think she will make him a good wife.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The royal pair moved together, Layla still veiled, and then
Queen Janahara stepped down from the dais and took a large mirror handed her by
a turbaned eunuch. She walked to the couple and stopped directly in front of
them. As they stood facing her, she held the mirror before Allaudin and reached
to lift Layla's veil, giving him his first glimpse of his bride.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth studied her with curiosity. She was plain. And she
looked very frightened.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It's auspicious, Inglish, if his first sight of his
bride is in a mirror. I have not seen her before either.&quot; Arangbar
examined her for a moment, then turned to Nadir Sharif. &quot;What do you
think? Should I buy him another one for his bed?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;She's a goddess of beauty, Majesty. Inspiration for a
poet.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Is that what you think?&quot; Arangbar sipped pensively
from his cup. &quot;Well, perhaps it's true. We'll discover soon enough if she
inspires her groom.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The guests watched as Allaudin and Layla were helped into a
large palanquin. In moments their procession was winding out of the palace,
followed by Layla's household silver, to a great fanfare of drums and trumpets
and the shouts of servants.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Peace on the Prophet!&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;There is no nobility but the nobility of
Mohammed!&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Allah be with Him, the noblest, the purest, the
highest!&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth settled back against his bolster and realized
groggily that it was already past two o'clock in the morning.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>When the wedding procession had disappeared from view, the
jubilant servants immediately turned to preparations for the banquet.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Sometimes life can be sweet, Inglish.&quot; Arangbar
leaned back against a bolster and pinched Janahara's hand. &quot;I think he
should have more wives. You know there's a saying in India: 'A man should have
four wives: A Persian to have someone to talk to; a Khurasani to keep his
house; a big-breasted Hindu from the South to nurse his children; and a Bengali
to whip, as a warning to the other three.' So far he has only the
Persian.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth noticed that Janahara did not join in the general
laughter. Then Arangbar took another drink and turned to Hawksworth.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But you know I don't entirely agree with that wisdom,
Inglish. The Holy Prophet, on whom be peace, wisely realized a man needs more
than one wife. He also demanded of us that we give each of them equal
attention, never to turn away from any one of them. What man can do that, even
with Allah's help? It is never possible. So we all do the best we can. It is
the will of Allah.&quot; Arangbar paused to swallow a ball of affion as he
watched the trays of lamb being placed before them. &quot;Tell me, Inglish,
have you found a wife for yourself yet?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Not as yet, Your Majesty.&quot; He paused. &quot;There
are so many to choose.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then take more than one, Inglish.&quot; Arangbar washed
down the opium.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It's not allowed for a Christian, Majesty.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then become a Muslim.&quot; Arangbar smiled and took
another sip from his glass. &quot;Are you circumcised, Inglish?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Majesty?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Never mind.&quot; Arangbar laughed out loud.
&quot;Neither am I. How are the mullahs to know? My father, Akman, actually
wanted to start his own religion, combining the wisdom of India, Persia, and
the West. He thought circumcision was an absurd practice. You know, there was
once a <i>feringhi </i>here, I believe he was Portuguese, who decided to become
a Muslim, a True Believer. Apparently he had found a Muslim woman he wanted to
marry, and her father declared she could never marry a Christian. So he had
himself circumcised.&quot; Arangbar paused dramatically. &quot;And immediately
bled to death. But doubtless he was healed by the time he reached Paradise.
Perhaps he made up there for what he missed here.&quot; Arangbar chuckled and
took a sip of wine. Hawksworth noticed that Queen Janahara was trying with
great difficulty to retain her pleased expression. &quot;Do you believe there
is a Paradise after death, Inglish?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What man can say. Majesty? No one has returned from
death to tell what he found. I think life is best lived in the present.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I've always believed the same, Inglish. And I've lived
as few men on Allah's earth have lived.&quot; Arangbar settled himself against
his bolster and reached for another glass. He was starting to grow visibly
tipsy. &quot;I now enjoy all Allah could possibly grant to a living man. There
is nothing on earth I cannot have. And yet, do you know, I still have many
griefs. Show me the man whose heart is free of grief.&quot; He took a piece of
lamb from a dish and washed it down. &quot;So I find my greatest happiness with
wine. Like a low-caste camel driver. Why must I still endure sorrow,
Inglish?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We all are mortal. Majesty.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That we are. Inglish. But I will soon see this Paradise,
if it exists. I will find out the truth soon enough. And when I'm finally wise,
who will then come after me? Now my sons practically war among themselves.
Someday, Inglish, I fear they may decide to war against me as well. And what of
those I see around me? Do they think I am blind to their deceit?&quot; Arangbar
leaned farther back on the bolster. Nadir Sharif sat listening, rolling a ball
of lamb between his fingers. &quot;Sometimes I think you may be the only honest
man left in India, Inglish. You are the only one who has ever dared refuse to <i>teslim</i>.
It is only with the greatest forbearance that I do not order you hanged.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;I thank Your Majesty.&quot; Hawksworth took a
decanter and poured more wine into Arangbar's glass before replenishing his
own.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;No, Inglish, instead you should thank your Christian
God. If He listens to you. But sometimes I wonder. I've heard you called a
heretic more than once.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And I have names for the Jesuits, Your Majesty. Would
you care to hear them?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;No, Inglish. Frankly, I have names for them too. But
tell me, what am I to do to find peace?&quot; Arangbar lowered his voice, but
only slightly. &quot;I see around me an army of sycophants, <i>nautch </i>women
dressed as men. Whom dare I trust? You know, my own people were once warriors,
Mongols of the steppes. They knew that the only ties that last are blood. And
that's why this wedding cheers me. It is blood to blood.&quot; Arangbar turned
and again touched Janahara's hand. Her face was expressionless as she accepted
the gesture. &quot;The only person in India I dare trust completely is my own
queen. She is the only one who cannot, will not deceive me. Never. I feel it is
true, as I feel nothing else in life. Nothing else.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Janahara's face remained a mask as Arangbar drank again.
Nadir Sharif was watching wordlessly, his face beginning to turn noticeably
grim. Hawksworth realized he had not been mentioned.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I have loved her since I was a youth, Inglish,&quot;
Arangbar continued, his voice growing maudlin. &quot;And she has never betrayed
my trust. That's the reason I would do anything she asked me. Anything,
anytime. I always know it is right.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth found himself marveling as he glanced at
Janahara's calculating eyes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I'd not trust her with two pence. He must be God's own fool.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Arangbar sat silent for a moment, savoring his own
pronouncement, then he turned to Janahara and spoke to her in a dull slur.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Ask something of me. Let me prove to the Inglish that I
can never deny you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Janahara turned as though she had not been listening.
Hawksworth knew she had been straining for every word.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What could I ask, Majesty? You have given me all I
could ever want. Tonight you even gave me a husband for my daughter. Now I can
die with the peace of Allah.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But I must give you something.&quot; He settled his
wine cup shakily on the carpet, jostling red splashes across the Persian
design. &quot;You must name it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But there is nothing I could ask that I do not already
have.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Sometimes you vex me with your good nature. The Inglish
will now suspect the Moghul of India is a vain braggart.&quot; He fumbled with
his turban, trying to detach the large blue sapphire attached to the front.
&quot;I will give you a jewel, even though you have not asked it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I beg Your Majesty.&quot; She reached to stay his hand.
&quot;There is nothing more I could ever want.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But I must give you something.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She smiled in defeat. &quot;If you must bestow a present, why
not give something to the bride and groom? This is their wedding, not
mine.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then at least you must name it. It will be my gift to
you through them.&quot; He turned to Hawksworth. &quot;Whatever else you do.
Inglish, never marry a Persian. They forever study to try your patience.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth noticed Nadir Sharifs eyes harden as he listened.
He slowly gripped the side of his bolster and absently pulled away a piece of
gold fringe.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then give them a small token, to show your confidence
in Allaudin.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I asked you to name it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Very well. Perhaps you could grant him the royal <i>jagirs
</i>in Dholpur, those closest to Agra.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Arangbar's sleepy eyes widened slightly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Those <i>jagirs </i>always go to the prince nearest the
throne. I granted them only last year to Prince Jadar, as part of his price to
undertake the campaign in the Deccan.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But Prince Allaudin can administer them more easily.
He's here. And you can compensate Jadar with others. Perhaps some in the north,
near the fortress of Qandahar? You'll have to send him there after the campaign
in the Deccan.&quot; Janahara's voice was silken now.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth turned to see Nadir Sharifs face growing ashen.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She's trying to drive Jadar into oblivion. Rob him of his
best estates, then send him to defend a piece of mountain rock. Surely Arangbar
will refuse. Jadar will never agree. She must know that. Nadir Sharif certainly
knows it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What would Prince Jadar say to such a trade?&quot;
Arangbar sipped from his wineglass and shifted slightly, his eyes again barely
in focus.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Why should he object? He's never here. And surely he'll
be ready to obey Your Majesty and return to defend Qandahar after he completes
his campaign in the south. The threat from the Persian Safavis in the north is
already growing.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I doubt very much he will agree so easily to march
north again. Not yet. Though I pray to Allah that he would.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then this will give him all the more reason.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;He may not see it as a reason. He may see it as a
betrayal. You know he's temperamental.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth suddenly found himself wondering if the trade had
been planned with Allaudin. It was obvious Nadir Sharif had been taken
completely by surprise.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then I suppose it's best dropped.&quot; Janahara turned
her face away. &quot;You can just forget I ever asked.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Arangbar looked crushed. He sipped thoughtfully on his wine
for a moment.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Perhaps if I consulted Prince Jadar first.&quot; He
paused to study his empty wine cup. &quot;The <i>jagirs </i> were granted . .
.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Perhaps Your Majesty thinks Prince Allaudin should have
no estates at all? Perhaps you think he is not yet fit?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;He's fit, by Allah. He's my son.&quot; Arangbar
impulsively seized another ball of opium and began to chew on it thoughtfully.
&quot;I’ll find a way to compensate Jadar. Surely he'll be reasonable. After
all, there must be a wedding gift.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then you'll agree to grant it?&quot; Janahara's tone
was quiet and inquiring.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Majesty.&quot; Nadir Sharifs voice seemed strangely
unguarded. &quot;Prince Jadar . . .&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Arangbar seemed not to hear him. &quot;I grant it. In the morning
I'll summon the <i>qazi</i>, and let this be recorded as my gift to my youngest
son and his new bride.&quot; Arangbar's tenseness seemed to dissolve as he
leaned back on the bolster and took another ball of opium. &quot;But only on
the condition that he perform his duty tonight. Let him plow the field he has
before he's granted more.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Arangbar turned to Hawksworth. &quot;Do you know what else
will happen, Inglish, if he fails in his duty the first night?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;No, Majesty.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Some of her women will send him a distaff, which they
use with their spinning wheels. With a message that since he cannot do a man's
work, it is fitting he should do a woman's. But I think he'll succeed.&quot;
Arangbar turned to Janahara with a wink. &quot;He's been practicing for months
with the <i>nautch </i>girls in the palace.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The queen did not smile as she took a rolled betel
leaf from a tray.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>A messenger appeared at the foot of the dais and performed
the <i>teslim</i>. His voice was quivering. &quot;The sheet has not yet come
out, may it please Your Majesty.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Arangbar laughed. &quot;Then perhaps the furrow is too narrow
to receive his plow. Have a mullah bless some water and send it in to him. And
tell him I'm waiting to see if he's yet a man.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;A Shi'ite mullah, Your Majesty, or a Sunni?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;From this night forward, he will have Shi'ite mullahs
perform all the duties for his household,&quot; Janahara interrupted.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The messenger performed the <i>teslim </i>to the queen and
backed from the room. Arangbar sat silent, drinking.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What does it matter?&quot; He finally turned to her.
&quot;Let him have whatever he pleases.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That is easy for you to say. But it does not please
Allah. Tonight should be taken as an omen.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Tonight is an omen of nothing. Tonight my son is
charged to make a woman out of a Persian girl of fifteen, who knows nothing of
her duties in bed. But he'll succeed. Give him time.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I think tonight is an omen. Allah is not pleased when
you allow open heresies to flourish.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Arangbar was watching a dancer who had approached the dais to
begin a suggestive <i>nautch </i>dance for him. It seemed to Hawksworth that they
were already well acquainted, for she smiled at him knowingly, avoiding the
queen's glance.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I care nothing for heresies.&quot; Arangbar turned back
to Janahara. &quot;I only care for the honor of my reign.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But a faith divided does you no honor.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;Then unite it if you care so much. I have
other duties.&quot; Arangbar turned again to watch the dancer. She had a large
ring in one side of her nose, and her eyes seemed to snap as she slapped her
bare feet against the carpeted floor. &quot;I never knew she was so good.&quot;
He turned to Nadir Sharif. &quot;Send her a small ruby and find out for me
tomorrow what her salary is. Whatever it is, I think she should have
more.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;As you wish. Majesty.&quot; Nadir Sharif bowed lightly
and turned again to watch the dancer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth studied the prime minister's face. It was grim,
leaden.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It's everything Shirin said would happen. Prince Jadar has
been stripped of his lands, and the queen has been granted license to start an
inquisition.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>You'd better get the <i>firman </i>signed, before the country
starts coming apart.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The doors of the hall burst open, and a crowd of women
entered. They carried a silver plate, on which was a folded silken sheet. They
moved quickly before the queen and performed the <i>teslim</i>. Then one held
out the plate.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The queen took the sheet and inspected it. Hawksworth watched
her, puzzling, then remembered that in Muslim society a bloodstained wedding
sheet is considered evidence, vital to the honor of both the families, of the
bride's virginity and the groom's virility. With a triumphant smile, Janahara
nodded and turned to exhibit the sheet to Arangbar.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>There were light pink traces across the white silk.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;He's a man after all.&quot; Arangbar passed the sheet
to Zainul Beg, who beamed and passed it to Nadir Sharif. The prime minister
smiled with approval.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;He has earned his <i>jagirs</i>.&quot; Arangbar turned
to Janahara. &quot;Let it be recorded. And now we feast.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>More silver dishes of baked lamp appeared from inside the
palace, brought by eunuchs who inspected them carefully before handing them to
serving women. The music and dancing were exultant now and lasted until the
light of dawn showed. The drunken guests waited reverently until Arangbar, who
had gone to sleep, was carried from the hall on a palanquin. Then they began to
disperse.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth reached Nadir Sharif’s side as the prime minister
was moving out through the large, tapestry-adorned doorway.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;What really happened tonight?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What do you mean, Ambassador?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The transfer of <i>jagirs</i>. What will Jadar
do?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Ambassador, that's a matter for the rulers of India to
decide. It's not your affair.&quot; Nadir Sharif did not look around.
&quot;Instead let me ask you a question. When will your English fleet make
landfall? They are overdue, but there have been no further sightings. I'm
beginning to wonder if there really is a fleet.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Perhaps the weather's been against them.&quot;
Hawksworth tried to steady himself on his feet. &quot;After all, it was sighted
by Jadar's men.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Was it? Or did you and Prince Jadar deceive us all? If
there's no fleet. Ambassador, you're in very serious trouble. There will be no <i>firman</i>.
His Majesty is hardly a fool.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;He promised to sign the <i>firman </i>long before the
sighting.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;You do not know him as I do. You have another
week, perhaps two, and then . . . Let me merely say you cannot drink the fleet
into existence. We are both going to have difficulty explaining this deception
to His Majesty. You met with the prince. I'm beginning to wonder now if you
both planned this. If you did, it was most unwise.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then wait two weeks and see.&quot; Hawksworth felt his
palms grow moist. &quot;Two weeks is not so long a time.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It is a very long time, Ambassador. Much is happening.
You have made many of the wrong friends. Good evening, Ambassador. I must speak
to Her Majesty.&quot; Nadir Sharif turned and was swallowed by the crowd.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As Hawksworth moved into the street, he saw that the front of
the palace was already bathed in morning light. And Agra was beginning to come
to life. He strolled for a time along the side of the Jamuna, where burned-out
candles still floated, and studied the outline of the Red Fort against the
morning sky.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>What if there really is no fleet? What if it really was a
trick by Jadar, for some reason of his own? To destroy my mission? Has he
cozened us all?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Midmorning was approaching when he finally reached his lodge
at the rear of Nadir Sharifs estate. As he passed through the curtained
doorway, he saw Kamala waiting, her eyes dark. She was wearing none of her
jewels.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Have you heard?&quot; She took his turban and knelt to
remove his <i>kamar-band</i>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;Heard what?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Do you know the Sufi Samad? And the Persian woman who
was with him?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth examined her, wondering who else knew of his stay

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>      
Father Manoel Pinheiro's clean-shaven face was grim and his lips set tightly
against the brisk air as he pushed a path through the crowded alley, headed
toward the riverside palace of Nadir Sharif. Around him large black cauldrons
of frying bread filled the dawn with the aroma of oil and spice. He had slipped
from the mission house at first light and, clasping his peaked black hat
tightly over his forehead, he had tried to melt inconspicuously among the
rattling bullock carts and noisy street vendors. Now he paused for breath and
watched as a large white cow licked the few grains of rice from the begging
bowl of a dozing leper. The image seemed to capture all the despair of India,
and he suddenly felt himself overwhelmed by the enormity of the Church's</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>burden.
Before he could move on, a crowd of chanting Hindus jostled him against a wall
as they poured into a small, garishly decorated temple brimming with
poly-colored heathen idols. On either side Hindu fakirs sat listlessly, long
white hair streaming down over their streaked faces, their limpid eyes devoid
of God's understanding. He shook his head sadly as he made the sign of the
cross over them, and found his heart near bursting.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>On every hand, he told himself, the fields are ripe unto
harvest, the flocks wanting a keeper. For every soul in this forgotten land we
bring to God and the Church, a hundred, nay a thousand, are born into eternal
darkness, damned forever. Our task is overwhelming, even with God's help.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He thought of the Holy Church, the Society of Jesus, and
their long years of disappointment in India. But now, at last, it seemed their
hopes and prayers might be nearing fulfillment. After all the years of
humiliation and ignominy, there seemed a chance, a genuine chance, that
Arangbar, the Great Moghul himself, would at last consent to be baptized into
the Holy Church. After him, all of India would surely soon follow.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Father Pinheiro crossed himself again, and prayed silently
that God would make him a worthy instrument of His will.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The burden of India was by now a Jesuit legend. It had been
taken up when the first mission came to the court of Akman over three decades
before. And even now the pagan fields of India remained, in many ways, the
greatest challenge of the Society of Jesus and the Holy Church.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>India had, it was true, been held in the grip of Portuguese
sea power for many years before the first mission arrived in Agra. But
Portuguese arms and trade had not served the work of the Church. They had
served the greed of Portuguese merchants and the coffers of Portuguese royalty.
The lost souls of India were denied the Grace of the Holy Church.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then, in 1540, a priest named Ignatius Loyola, once a
nobleman and a soldier, founded the Society of Jesus, whose dual purpose was to
defend the Holy Church against the Protestant Reformation and begin preaching
the True Faith</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>to the pagan
lands of Asia and the Americas. In 1542 the Society of Jesus reached Portuguese
Goa, on the very shores of India, in the person of Francis Xavier, a close
friend of Ignatius Loyola's from student days at the University of Paris.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>With Goa as base of operations, the society had immediately
pushed farther eastward, reaching Japan and Macao a few short years later.
Paradoxically, it was India itself that had initially eluded their influence.
Finally, in 1573, the Great Akman journeyed south and encountered the members
of the Society of Jesus for the first time. He was awed by their learning and
moral integrity, and soon thereafter he posted an envoy to Goa requesting that
a Jesuit mission be sent to his court. Three Jesuit fathers traveled to
Fatehpur Sekri.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The Jesuits' hopes soared when they were immediately invited
to debate the orthodox Islamic mullahs at Akman's court. The leader of the
mission, a soft-spoken Italian father with encyclopedic learning, knew the
Quran well in translation and easily refuted the mullahs' absolutist
arguments—to the obvious delight of Akman. It was only after several months at
Fatehpur Sekri that the three learned fathers began to suspect that Akman's
real purpose in inviting them was to have on hand skilled debaters for
entertainment.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Akman may have had scant patience with Islam, but it had
grown obvious he had no desire to become a Christian either. He was an
intellectual who amused himself by questioning the ideas and teachings of all
faiths, with the inevitable result that he always found something in each to
affront his own reason. He was, in fact, beginning to form the notion that he
himself was as great a leader as any of the spiritual teachers he had heard
about, and accordingly should simply declare himself an object of worship.
After a decade the three Jesuits finally conceded their first mission was a
failure and abjectly returned to Goa.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Almost a decade later, in 1590, Akman again requested that
Jesuit fathers be sent to his court. Once more a mission was sent, and once
more its members eventually concluded Akman had no real intention of
encouraging Christianity in India. The second mission was also abandoned.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>There remained some, however, in Goa and in Rome, who
believed the Great Moghul Akman still could be converted. Furthermore, as the
Protestant countries began to venture into the Indies, the political usefulness
of having Portuguese priests near the ruler of India became increasingly
obvious. Thus, in 1595, a third mission was sent to Akman's court. Father
Pinheiro remembered well their instructions upon departing Goa. They would
convert Akman if they could; but equally important now, they would ensure that
Portuguese trading interests were protected.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The Jesuit fathers drew close to Akman, became valued
advisers, and found themselves being consulted on questions ranging from
whether Jesus was the Son of God or merely a Prophet, to the advisability of
smoking tobacco. Still, the only lasting achievement of the mission was to
extract from Akman a <i>firman </i>granting Jesuits the right to free exercise
of the Catholic religion. They wanted his soul, and through it the soul of
India, but the most they ever attained was his protection. He died a royal
skeptic, but a sovereign whose religious tolerance shocked the dogmatic
sixteenth-century world.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Father Pinheiro paused to study the outline of the Red Fort
against the morning sky and listened to the <i>azan </i>call to Islamic prayer
sounding from a nearby mosque. He smiled to think that the schism between the
rule of Arangbar and the rule of Islam might soon be complete. Like Akman,
Arangbar had never bothered to hide his distaste for the mullahs who flooded
his court. He collected Italian paintings of the Virgin for his palace, even
scandalizing the mullahs by hanging one in the <i>Diwan-i-Am</i>, and whenever
one of the Jesuit fathers journeyed to Goa, there was always a request for more
Christian art. True the Moghul’s understanding of blasphemy was erratic, as
evidenced by a recent evening in the <i>Diwan-i-Khas </i>when, drunk and
roaring with laughter, Arangbar had set a wager with the Jesuits on how long he
could stand with his arms outstretched as a cross. But then he had built a
church for the mission, and also provided them a house, which he now visited
ever more frequently to secretly indulge his passion for forbidden pork.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>A scant two months before, Arangbar had taken an action that
sent the mission's hopes soaring. He had summoned the Jesuit fathers to baptize
two of his young nephews, ordering the boys to become Christians. The mullahs
had been outraged, immediately spreading the pernicious rumor he had done so
merely to better remove them from the line of succession. In Goa, however, the
mission was roundly congratulated on nearing its goal. If Arangbar became a
Christian, many in his court and perhaps eventually all of India would someday
follow.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>This had all been before the arrival of the English heretic,
Hawksworth. At the very moment when Arangbar's mind seemed within their grasp,
there had now emerged the specter that all their work might be undone. Arangbar
had treated the Englishman as though he were qualified to speak on theological
matters and had even questioned him about the most Holy Sacrament, when the
Church's doctrine regarding this Mystery had already been fully expounded to
him by Father Sarmento himself. Arangbar had listened with seeming interest
while the Englishman proceeded to tell him much that was contrary to the Truth
and to Church teaching. When asked point blank, the Englishman had even denied
that His Holiness, the pope, should be acknowledged head of the Universal
Church, going on to characterize His Holiness' political concerns in almost
scatological terms. Father Sarmento, normally the most forbearing of priests,
was nearing despair.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Most disturbing of all, Arangbar had only last week asked the
Englishman by what means the Portuguese fortress at the northern port of Diu
could be recaptured by India. The Englishman had confided that he believed a
blockade by a dozen English frigates, supported by an Indian land army of no
more than twenty thousand, could force the Portuguese garrison to capitulate
from hunger!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Clearly Arangbar was growing eccentric. The English heretic
had beguiled him and was near to becoming a serious detriment to Portuguese interests.
To make matters worse, there was the latest dispatch from Goa, which had
arrived only the previous evening. Father Pinheiro had studied it well into the
night, and finally concluded that the time had come to stop the Englishman. He
also concluded it was time to make this unmistakably clear to Nadir Sharif. As
the situation continued to deteriorate, only the influence of Nadir Sharif
could still neutralize the Englishman.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Father Pinheiro moved on through the jostling street,
occasionally swabbing his brow. And as he looked about him, he began to dream
of the day there would be a Christian India. It would be the society's greatest
triumph. What would it be like? What would Arangbar do to silence the heretical
mullahs? Would the time come when India, like Europe, would require an
Inquisition to purify the sovereignty of the Church?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>One thing was certain. With a Catholic monarch in India,
there would be no further English trade, no Dutch trade, no Protestant trade.
The declining fortunes of Portuguese commerce at Goa, the Protestant challenge
to Portuguese supremacy in the Indies, would both be permanently reversed in a
single stroke.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The thought heartened him as he looked up to see the
sandstone turrets of Nadir Sharif’s palace gleaming in the morning sun.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Father, it is always a pleasure to see you.&quot; Nadir
Sharif bowed lightly and indicated a bolster. He did not order refreshments
from the servants. &quot;No matter what the hour.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I realize the time is early. I wanted to find you at
home. And to come here when there were the fewest possible eyes on the
street.&quot; Pinheiro paused and then decided to sit. He was perspiring
heavily from the walk, even though the real heat of the day lay hours ahead.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Nadir Sharif flinched at the Jesuit's school-book Persian and
examined him with ill-concealed disdain, knowing word of his visit surely had
already found the ears of the queen.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then I should ask the occasion for this unexpected
pleasure.&quot; Nadir Sharif seated himself and discreetly examined the
Jesuit's soiled black habit.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The English trading fleet, Excellency. The news is most
disturbing. I received a pigeon last evening from His Excellency, Miguel
Vaijantes. The armada he dispatched along the coast to sweep for the English
fleet returned three days ago, finding nothing. The English may have eluded us.
He has now ordered the armada to sail north from Goa, into the bay, but by now
the English fleet could be nearing Surat, or perhaps they have veered north to
the port of Cambay. His Excellency fears that they may possibly escape our
patrols entirely and make landfall. He has asked me to inform you privately
that the <i>firman </i>for English trade must be delayed at all costs, until
the English fleet can be sighted and engaged.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I have made every effort. The Viceroy knows that.&quot;
Nadir Sharif casually adjusted the jewel on his turban. &quot;It has been
stopped so far.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But if the fleet lands? And if the heretic English king
has sent new gifts for His Majesty?&quot; Pinheiro tried to maintain his
dignity as he nervously wiped his face with the black fold of a sleeve.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;If the English do make landfall, and dispatch more
gifts for His Majesty, I fear no power in Agra can stop him from signing the <i>firman</i>.''
Nadir Sharifs face assumed an expression of conciliatory resignation. &quot;The
English will undoubtedly make the trading <i>firman</i> a condition of further
presents.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You know that is unacceptable, Excellency.&quot;
Pinheiro's eyes narrowed. &quot;The mission cannot allow it. You know that as
well as I.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Forgive me, but I've always understood your mission
here was not to concern itself with trade.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The Holy Church is not engaged in trade, Excellency.
But our position here is dependent, as you are well aware, on the fortunes of
Goa. The two are entwined, as are all secular and spiritual aspects of life.
Whatever disturbs one must inevitably affect the other. It cannot be
otherwise.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Obviously.&quot; Nadir Sharif stroked the tip of his
moustache a moment in thought. &quot;So what would you have me do? The English <i>feringhi
</i>cannot be harmed. He drinks every evening with His Majesty.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;There are other ways to negate the heretic's influence.
Perhaps the Englishman's . . . situation with His Majesty can be rendered less
intimate. Perhaps he could be removed from favor. If only for a time.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;So you have come to ask me to work miracles for you,
when you do nothing for yourself.&quot; Nadir Sharif rose and strolled to a
latticework window. He studied the garden for a moment, then spoke without
turning. &quot;Have you advised His Majesty in explicit terms of the Viceroy's
displeasure with the English intrusion into our . . . into Portuguese
waters?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It has been made known. Many times.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But have you suggested the consequences?&quot; Nadir
Sharif turned and gazed past Pinheiro, his eyes playing on the scalloped marble
arch of the entryway.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The consequences are obvious. The warships at Goa are
capable of terminating all trade in the Indian Ocean if His Excellency so
pleases.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then you should merely engage the English.&quot; Nadir
Sharif consciously deleted the irony from his voice.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That is an entirely separate matter. The English
frigates are of a new design, very swift. They may possibly have eluded us for
a time.&quot; Pinheiro's voice hardened. &quot;But do not doubt our galleons
are swifter than any of the trading vessels of His Majesty's fleet. India's own
Red Sea trade continues only at the Viceroy's discretion.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That is true enough. But are you prepared to
demonstrate your . . . displeasure.&quot; Nadir Sharif revolved back to the
window. &quot;I do not think His Majesty actually believes the Viceroy would
ever take hostile action.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What are you suggesting?&quot; Pinheiro's voice
betrayed momentary disbelief.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Nothing that you have not already brought to His
Majesty's attention. But possibly he does not believe you have the conviction,
or the strength, to carry it through. The English <i>feringhi </i>constantly
brags to him of English superiority at sea, hinting that his king will soon
drive Portugal from the Indian Ocean. I've heard it so often myself I confess
I'm near to believing him too.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I can assure you that the protection, and control, of
India's ports will always remain in Portuguese hands.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then you would still have me believe you have the power
to impound Indian shipping, even a vessel owned by His Majesty, thereby
exposing the English as helpless to prevent it?&quot; Nadir Sharif seemed
absorbed in the garden, his hands clasped easily behind him in perfect repose.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Of course.&quot; Pinheiro stood dazed at the
implications of Nadir Sharifs words. He paused for a moment, digesting them.
&quot;Do I understand you to be suggesting the Viceroy take hostile action
against one of His Majesty's own trading ships?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You have contested the Englishman with words, and he
seems to be winning.&quot; Nadir Sharif turned and examined Pinheiro.
&quot;Your Viceroy is undoubtedly aware that Her Majesty, Queen Janahara, is
equally disturbed by the Englishman. She too is concerned with the possible
effects on her . . . trading arrangements if the English gain undue
influence.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Would she be willing to speak to His Majesty?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Again you talk merely of words. What have they gained
you?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Father Sarmento would never consent to an overt action.
He would be too fearful of the possible consequences to the mission.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Bold measures are for bold men. I think His Excellency,
Miguel Vaijantes, understands boldness. And His Majesty understands boldness
better than anyone.&quot; Nadir Sharif paused. &quot;It may be of interest to
His Excellency to know that His Majesty currently has a vessel en route from
the Red Sea, with cargo owned by the mother of His Majesty, the dowager Maryam
Zamani. It is due to make landfall within the week, if it has managed to hold
its schedule. The vessel's safety is, quite naturally, of utmost concern to His
Majesty . . .&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I think I understand.&quot; Father Pinheiro again
swabbed the moisture from his brow. &quot;But Father Sarmento . . .&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What possible concern could Father Sarmento have with
decisions made by His Excellency, Miguel Vaijantes? He is the Viceroy.&quot;
Nadir Sharif nodded toward a pudgy eunuch hovering at the doorway, who
immediately entered with a tray of betel leaves, signaling that the meeting was
adjourned.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;His Excellency will undoubtedly be most appreciative of
your thoughts.&quot; Pinheiro paused. &quot;Still, wouldn't it be prudent to
advise Her Majesty, lest she mistake our Viceroy's intentions?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I will attend to it.&quot; Nadir Sharif smiled warmly.
&quot;You must be aware, however, that if His Majesty chooses to respond
irresponsibly, I will know nothing about any action that may be taken. The
Viceroy must weather his own seas.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Naturally.&quot; Pinheiro bowed. &quot;You have always
been a friend. I thank you, and bless you in God's name.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Your thanks are sufficient.&quot; Nadir Sharif smiled
again and watched as the Jesuit was led through the scalloped doorway by the
waiting eunuch.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Only when he turned back to the window did he realize his
palms were drenched with perspiration.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Arangbar moved groggily through the arched corridor carrying
a fresh silver cup of wine and quietly humming the motif of his favorite
Hindustani raga. His afternoon nap in the <i>zenana </i>had been fitful,
unusually so, and when he finally admitted to himself why, he had dismissed the
two young women who waited to pleasure him, retrieved his jeweled turban, and
waved aside the attending eunuchs. He had announced he wanted to stroll among
the fruit trees in the courtyard of the Anguri Bagh, which lay down the marble
steps from the Khas Mahal, the breezy upper pavilion of the <i>zenana</i>. But
when he reached the trees, he had turned and slipped through his private
doorway leading to the women's apartments in the lower level of the fort.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The <i>zenana </i>was quiet, even the eunuchs were dozing,
and no one noticed when he passed along the shadowed afternoon corridor toward
the circular staircase leading to the lower apartments. As he began to descend
the curved stone steps, he felt his legs momentarily grow unsteady, and he
paused to rest against the hard polished wall, tightening his light brocade
cloak against the cooler air and taking a short sip of wine for warmth. Then he
continued on, carefully feeling for each step in the dim light of the overhead
oil lamps.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He emerged on the next level and stopped to catch his breath
on the balcony that opened out over the Jamuna. This was the level where he had
built private apartments for his favorite women, and behind him was the large
room, with a painted cupola ceiling high above a large rose-shaped marble
fountain, which he had granted to one of his Hindu wives. (Now he could no
longer recall precisely who she was; she had reached thirty some time past and
he had not summoned her to his couch in many years.) Since she was a devout
Hindu, he had ordered it decorated with brilliantly colored scenes from the
Ramayana. The room itself was cooled by a high waterfall in the rear that
murmured down an inclined and striated marble slab. Stairways on either side of
the room curved around to an overhead balcony, directly above where he now
stood, which was the post where eunuchs waited when the women came to cool
themselves by the fountain.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The balcony where he now stood jutted out from the fort, supported
by thick sandstone columns, and from his position he could look along the side
of the fort and see the Jasmine Tower of Queen Janahara. When he realized he
also could be seen, he instinctively stepped back into the cool corridor.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The women were inside their apartments, asleep, and the
corridor empty as he began to descend the circular stairs leading to the next
level below, the quarters for eunuchs and female servants. As he rounded the
last curve of the stair and emerged into the light, three eunuchs stared up in
shock from their game of cards. It vaguely registered that they probably were
gambling, which he had strictly prohibited in the <i>zenana</i>, but he decided
to ignore it this afternoon.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The circular pasteboard cards of the eunuchs' scattered across
the stone floor as they hurried to <i>teslim</i>. He paused to</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>drink again
from the cup and absently studied the painted faces on the cards dropped by the
eunuch nearest him. It was not a bad hand. Lying on the marble were four high
cards from the <i>bishbar</i>, powerful, suits—the lord of horses, the king of
elephants, the king of infantry, and the throned <i>wazir </i>of the fort—and
three from the <i>kambar</i>, weaker, suits—the king of snakes, the king of
divinities, and the throned queen. He stared for a moment at the king of
elephants, the suit he always preferred to play, and wondered at the
happenstance that the king had fallen beneath the queen, whose face covered his
golden crown. He shrugged it away as coincidence and turned toward the stairs
leading to the next lower level.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Two more levels remained.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The air was increasingly musty now, noticeably smoky from the
lamps, and he hurried on, reaching the next landing without stopping. The
windows on this level had shrunk to only a few hand spans, and now they were
secured with heavy stone latticework. The eunuchs were arguing at the other end
of the corridor and failed even to notice him. He told himself to try to
remember this, and drank again as he paused to listen to the metrical splash of
the Jamuna lapping against the outer wall. Then he stepped quietly down the
last flight of stairs.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The final level. As he emerged into the corridor, two
guarding eunuchs who had been dozing leaped to their feet and drew swords
before recognizing him. Both fell on their face in <i>teslim</i>, their turbans
tumbling across the stone floor.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Arangbar said nothing, merely pointed toward a doorway at the
end of the corridor. The startled eunuchs strained against their fat as they
lifted torches from the walls and then turned officiously to lead the way. As
they walked, Arangbar paused to stare through an arched doorway leading into a
large domed room off the side of the hall. A dozen eunuchs were inside, some
holding torches while others laced a white cotton rope through a wooden pulley
attached to the lower side of a heavy wooden beam that spanned the room,
approximately ten feet above the floor.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The two eunuchs with Arangbar also stopped, wondering</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>if His
Majesty had come to supervise the hanging that afternoon of the two <i>zenana </i>women
who had been discovered in a flagrant sexual act in the Shish Mahal, the
mirrored <i>zenana </i>baths.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Arangbar studied the hanging room for a moment with glazed
eyes, not remembering that he had sentenced the women that same morning, and
then waved the guards on along the corridor, past the doors that secured dark
cells. These were the cells used to confine women who had broken <i>zenana </i>regulations.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>At the end of the corridor was a door wider than the
others, and behind it was a special cell, with a window overlooking the Jamuna.
He walked directly to the door and drank again from his cup as he ordered it
opened. The guards were there at once, keys jangling. The door was massive and
thick, and it creaked heavily on its hinges as they pushed it slowly inward.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>From the gloom came the unmistakable fragrance of musk and
sandalwood. He inhaled it for a moment and it seemed to penetrate his memory,
calling up long forgotten pleasures. Grasping the door for support, he moved
past the bowing guards and into the cell. There, standing by the small barred
window, her face caught in a shaft of afternoon sun, was Shirin.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Her eyes were carefully darkened with kohl and her mouth red
and fresh. She wore a gossamer scarf decorated with gold thread, and a thin
skirt that betrayed the curve of her thighs against the outline of her flowered
trousers. The musty air of the room was immersed in her perfume, as though by
her very being she would defy the walls of her prison. She looked just as he
had remembered.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She turned and stared at him for a moment, seeming not to
believe what she saw. Then her eyes hardened.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Shall I <i>teslim </i>before my sentence?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Arangbar said nothing as he examined her wordlessly, sipping
slowly from his almost-empty cup. Now more than ever he realized why she had
once been his favorite. She could bring him to ecstasy, and then recite Persian
poetry to him for hours. She had been exquisite.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You're as beautiful as ever. Too beautiful. What do you
expect me to do with you?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I expect that I will die, Your Majesty. That, I think,
is the usual sentence for the women who disobey you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;You could have stayed in Surat, where you were
sent. Or gone on to Goa with the husband I gave you. But instead you returned
here. Why?&quot; Arangbar eased himself onto the stone bench beside the door.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I don't think you would understand, Majesty.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Did you come because of the Inglish <i>feringhi?</i> I
learned yesterday that you conspired to meet with him. It displeased me very
much.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;He was not responsible, Majesty. I met with him because
I chose to. But I came to Agra to be with Samad again.&quot; Her voice began to
tremble slightly. &quot;Samad is guilty of nothing, except defiance of the
Shi'ite mullahs. You know that as well as I. If you want to hear me beg for
him, I will.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Arangbar seemed not to notice the tear that stained the kohl
beneath one eye. &quot;It was a death sentence for you to disobey me and come
back. Perhaps you actually want to die.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Is there nothing you would die for, Majesty?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Arangbar stared for a moment at the window, its hexagonal
grillwork throwing a pattern across his glazed eyes. He seemed to be searching
for words. &quot;Yes, perhaps I might die for India. Perhaps someday soon I
will. But I would never die for the glory of Islam.&quot; His gaze came back to
Shirin. &quot;And certainly not for some half-naked Sufi mullah.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Samad is not a mullah.&quot; By force of will she held
any trace of shrillness from her voice. &quot;He is a Persian poet. One of the
greatest ever. You know that. He defies the Shi'ites because he will not bow to
their dogma.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The Shi'ites want his head.&quot; Arangbar examined his
empty cup and tossed it to the floor, listening as the silver rang hard against
the stone. &quot;It seems a small price for tranquility.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Whose tranquility? Theirs?&quot; The tears were gone
now, her eyes again defiant.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Mine. Every day I'm flooded with petitions about this
or that heresy. It wearies and consumes me. Samad ignored the laws of Islam,
and he has followers.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot; You ignore the laws of Islam.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Arangbar laughed. &quot;It's true. Between us, I despise the
mullahs. You know I once told them I had decided to become a Christian, because
I enjoyed eating pork and the Prophet denied it to all men. The next day they
brought the Quran and declared although it was true pork was denied to men, the
Prophet said nothing specifically about what a king could eat. So there was no
need for me to become a Christian.&quot; He paused and sobered. &quot;But Samad
is not a king. He is a well-known Sufi. The mullahs claim that if he's dead,
the inspiration for heresy will die with him. They say his death will serve as an
example. I hear this everywhere, even from Her Majesty.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Her Majesty?&quot; Shirin searched for his eyes as she
spoke, but they were shrouded in shadow. &quot;Does she make laws for you
now?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;She disrupts my tranquility with all her talk about
Islam and Shi'ites. Perhaps it's age. She never used to talk about the
Shi'ites. But now she wants to bring the Islam of Persia to India. She forbade
Sunni mullahs even to attend the wedding. But if it pleases her, what does it
matter? I despise them all.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But why Samad? Why sentence him to death?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Frankly I don't really care about this poet, either
way. But he has not tried to help himself. When I allowed him to confront the
mullahs who accused him, he refused to recite the Kalima, 'There is no God but
Allah.'&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What did he say?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Perhaps just to spite them, he would only recite the
first phrase, 'There is no God,' the negation. He refused to recite the rest,
the affirmation. He said he was still searching for truth. That when he finally
saw God he would recite the remainder; that to affirm His existence without
proof would be giving false evidence. I thought the mullahs would strangle him
on the spot.&quot; Arangbar laughed to himself as he watched her turn again to
the window. &quot;You have to admit that qualifies as blasphemy, by any measure.
So if the mullahs want him so badly, why not let them have him?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But Samad is a mystic, a pantheist.&quot; Shirin
returned her eyes to Arangbar. &quot;For him God is everywhere, not just where
the mullahs choose to put Him. Do you remember those quatrains in his Rubaiyat
that say,</span></p>

although his God sounds a bit too benign to be Allah. But I also know his

since dead by then.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Arangbar rose unsteadily and moved beside her, staring out
onto the glinting surface of the Jamuna. For a moment he watched a fleet of
barges pass, piled high with dark bundles of indigo. &quot;I believe I myself
will die someday soon. I can almost feel my strength ebbing. But I hope I'll be
remembered as my father Akman is, a ruler who tolerated all faiths. I've
protected Hindus from the bigoted followers of Mohammed's religion, who would
convert them forcibly to Islam, and I've allowed all religions to build places
of worship. Did you know I've even built a church for the Portuguese Jesuits,
who have to buy most of their converts with bribes? I even gave them a stipend,
since they would starve otherwise. They tell me they're astonished I allow so
much religious freedom here, since it's unheard of in Europe. But I can do all
this only if I remain the nominal defender of Islam. Islam holds the power in
India, and as India's ruler I must acknowledge that. I can defy the mullahs
myself now and then. But I can't permit your Sufi mystic to do it too. There's
a limit.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You can do anything. If you wish. The orthodox mullahs
have always hated mystics. The Shi'ite mullahs are men who live on hate. You
see it burning in their eyes. They even hate their own women, can't you see?
They keep them prisoner, claiming that's the way they honor and respect them.
The mullahs even resent that Samad allows me to come into his presence without
a veil.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;They say he's a poison in Islam.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Yes, his example is poison. His poetry is filled with
love. The mullahs cannot bear it, since their own lives are filled with hate.
God help India if it ever becomes an 'Islamic’ state. There'll be mobs in the
streets murdering Hindus in the name of 'God.' Is that the tranquility you
want?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I want to die in peace. Just like your poet. And I want
to be remembered, for the good I've done for India.&quot; Arangbar paused,
seeming to search on the stone ledge for his cup. &quot;I think Samad will be
remembered too. Tomorrow I'll make him famous. Let him live on through his
words. He knows, and I know, that he must die. We understand each other
perfectly. I can't disappoint him now.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Arangbar suddenly recalled the high-ranking Rajput raja who
had asked for an early audience in the <i>Diwan-i-Khas</i>, and he turned and
moved unsteadily toward the door. When he reached it, he revolved and looked
back sadly at Shirin.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;I found myself dreaming about you this
afternoon. I don't know why. So I decided to come and see you, alone. I didn't
come to talk about Samad. It's you I'm uncertain about. Her Majesty wants you
hanged. But I cannot yet find the courage to sentence you.&quot; Arangbar
continued on wearily toward the door. &quot;Where will it all end?&quot; He
paused and, as though remembering something, turned again. &quot;Jadar is
plotting something against me, I sense it. But I don't know what he can do.
Recently I've heard rumors you're part of it. Have you turned against me?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;If you kill Samad, I will defy you with every power I
have.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then perhaps I should execute you.&quot; He stared at
her, trying to focus. &quot;But you have no powers left. Unless you're plotting
something with the Inglish. If you are, then I will kill you both.&quot; He
turned to leave, tightening his cloak against the chill. The guards saw him emerge
and hurried from the far end of the corridor. Arangbar watched them for a
moment, then turned and looked one last time at Shirin. &quot;Samad will die
tomorrow. You will have to wait.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Brian Hawksworth's lean frame towered above the crowd,
conspicuous in jerkin and seaboots. He had heard the rumor and he had come to
the plaza to watch, mingling among the turbaned assembly of nobles,
shopkeepers, mullahs, and assorted street touts. His presence was immediately
noted by all, especially the crippled beggars in dirty brown <i>dhotis</i>, who
dragged themselves through the crowd, their leprosy-withered hands upturned,
calling for a <i>pice</i> in the name of Allah. They knew from experience that,
however ragged a <i>feringhi </i>might appear, he was always more likely to be
moved by their plight than a wealthy Indian merchant.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The plaza was a confined area between the steep eastern side
of the Red Fort and the outer wall of the fortress. Beyond the fortress wall
lay the wide Jamuna River, while high above, and with a commanding view of the
plaza, sat Arangbar, watching from the black throne at the outer edge of the <i>Diwan-i-Khas</i>.
Next to him sat Queen Janahara and Allaudin. The day was Tuesday and the sun
was approaching midday. As Hawksworth pushed his way to the front of the crowd,
the last elephant fight of the morning had just begun.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Two First-ranked bull elephants were locked head to head in
the dusty square. Their blunted tusks were wreathed with brass rings, and the
back of each was covered with a brocaded canvas on which sat two riders.
Perched on each animal's neck and directing it was its mahout, and on its rump
sat its Second-ranked keeper, whose assignment was to urge the animal to
greater frenzy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The dusty air was alive with a festive clanging from large
bells attached to each elephant's harness. Hawksworth noticed that a long
chain, called the <i>lor langar</i>, was secured to the left foreleg of each
elephant and circled over its back, where it was attached to a heavy log held
by the second rider. Both elephants also had other keepers who ran alongside
holding long poles, at the end of which was crossed a foot- long piece of
paper-covered bamboo. Nearby another keeper stood holding a smoldering taper.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth watched in awe as the elephants backed away and
lunged together again and again, tusk resounding against tusk, often rearing on
their hind legs as each strained for advantage.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Do you have a favorite, <i>feringhi </i>Sahib?&quot; A
brown-skinned man with a slightly soiled turban was tugging at Hawksworth's
sleeve. &quot;There is still time to wager.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;No thanks.&quot; Hawksworth moved to brush him aside.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But it is our habit in India to wager on the elephants,
Sahib. Perhaps the Sahib does not yet know Indian customs?&quot; He pushed
closer, directly in Hawksworth's face. His few remaining teeth were stained red
with betel. &quot;I myself am a poor judge of elephants, l can never guess
which will win. Still I love to wager. May Allah forgive me.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm not here to bet.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Just this once, Sahib. For my weakness.&quot; He turned
and pointed through the dust. &quot;Although the dark elephant is smaller and
already growing tired, I will even offer to bet on him to give you, a guest in
India, a chance to win. So when you return to your <i>feringhistan </i>someday,
you will say there is one honest man in India. I will wager you ten rupees the
dark one will be declared the winner.&quot; The man backed away for an instant
and discreetly assessed Hawksworth's worn jerkin with a quick glance. &quot;If
ten rupees are too much, I will wager you five.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth studied the two elephants again. The dark one was
slightly smaller, and did seem to be growing tired. The other elephant, larger
and brown, had a mahout less skilled but he also clearly was gaining the
advantage.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;All right. I'll take the brown.&quot; Hawksworth
reached for his purse, feeling slightly relieved that it was still there.
&quot;And I'll lay twenty rupees.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;As pleases the Sahib.&quot; The man smiled broadly.
&quot;The Sahib must be a very rich man in his <i>feringhistan</i>.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Even as he spoke, the large brown elephant wheeled and</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>slammed its
black adversary in the side with its tusks, barely missing the leg of the
mahout. The black elephant staggered backward, against the side of the fort. It
was now clearly on the defensive, as the larger elephant began slamming it
repeatedly in the side.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth found himself caught up in the taste of imminent
victory.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Charkhi! Charkhi!&quot; A cry began to rise from the
crowd. The man holding the burning taper looked up toward Arangbar, who
signaled lightly with his hand. Then the men holding the long poles tipped them
toward the taper, and the two ends of papered bamboo were quickly ignited.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The bamboo sticks started to whirl like pinwheels, popping
and throwing sparks from the gunpowder packed inside. The keepers turned and
thrust the poles under the face of the brown elephant, sending him rearing
backward in fright.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Although the black elephant now lay crushed against the wall,
the brown was too distracted by the sudden noise to press his advantage.
Instead he wheeled away from the exploding bamboo and began to charge wildly
toward the edge of the crowd. Retreating bodies pummeled about Hawksworth, and
there were frightened calls of &quot;<i>lor langar</i>.&quot; As the elephant
neared the crowd, its second rider, with a look of infinite regret, threw down
the log chained to its forefoot. The chain whipped against its leg, and in
moments it was tangled and stumbling.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>By then the smaller black elephant had recovered its feet and
came galloping in chase. In moments he was there, slamming his larger adversary
with his tusks. The brown elephant stumbled awkwardly, tangled in the chain,
and then collapsed into the dust. With a victory yell the mahout of the black
elephant pulled a cord releasing a canvas cloth over its eyes. The heaving
animal immediately began to gentle, and its jubilant keepers ran forward to
lead it away.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Your elephant lost, Sahib. My regrettings. May I have
the twenty rupees?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But it was fixed!&quot; Hawksworth held tightly to his
purse.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>&quot;The
brown was clearly winning before he was frightened by the damned
fireworks.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Did I neglect to tell the Sahib that the black elephant
is a <i>khasa</i>, from His Majesty's private stable? His Majesty does not like
to see his elephants lose.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You conniving bastard.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;His Majesty makes the rules. Sahib. It is permitted to
use the <i>charkhi </i>fireworks once during a contest, if His Majesty judges
that the elephants need to be disciplined. May Allah grant you better luck next
week.&quot; The man stood waiting, hand outstretched.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;You're a damned thief.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That is a harsh judgment. Sahib. I am merely a poor man
who must live. If you wait, you will see what happens to criminals here.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>With a sigh of resignation Hawksworth began to count out the
twenty silver rupees, trying to look as sporting as he could muster. He found
himself in grudging admiration of the swindler's style. Then he suddenly
realized what the man had said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The rumors must have been right.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You mean there'll be an execution?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;This is the day. His Majesty always has executions on
Tuesday, after the elephant fights.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth looked up to see another bull elephant being
ridden into the plaza. He had sharpened tusks, each decorated with a single
heavy brass ring, and was guided by a single rider, a fierce-looking, unshaven
mahout. The elephant was festooned with bells, but there were no chains about any
of its legs.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>At the other end of the square a balding man, with a short
black beard and a ragged green cloak, was being dragged forward by Imperial
guards. Hawksworth noticed that his arms had been bound behind him, by a heavy
cord circled just above the elbows. His eyes brimmed with fear.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The guards shoved him struggling toward the middle of the
plaza. When they reached the central clearing, the officer of the guard knocked
him to his knees with the butt end of a lance. The stunned prisoner turned to
watch in terror as the elephant lumbered toward him, flapping its ears in
anticipation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;He was sentenced yesterday, Sahib.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What did he do? Steal some nobleman's sheep? In England
that's a hanging offense.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Oh no, Sahib, Islamic law does not give the death
penalty for theft, unless a thief is notorious. And even then he must be caught
in the act. If it is proved you have stolen something worth more than a certain
amount, then the sentence is to have your right hand cut off. But for that to
happen there must either be two witnesses or the thief must himself confess.
Islamic law is not cruel; it is just.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What's this man accused of then?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;He was tried and found guilty under Islamic law of <i>qatlul-'amd</i>,
a willful murder. His name is Kaliyan, and he is a Hindu and the son of Bijai
Ganga Ram. He is accused of having kept a common Muslim woman as his concubine,
and when the woman's father discovered this and went to reclaim her to restore
his family's honor, this man murdered him and buried him behind his house. He
confessed the act yesterday morning before His Majesty.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The elephant moved with calm deliberation toward the kneeling
prisoner, guided by the mahout, until it towered directly over the quivering
man. Suddenly it whipped its trunk about the man's torso and lifted him
squirming into the air, holding him firmly against its banded tusks. It swung
the screaming man back and forth in delight for a long moment, seeming to
relish the torment, then dashed him violently to the ground.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The prisoner hit on his back, gasping, and weakly tried to
roll to his feet. Before he could gain his footing, the elephant was there
again, seizing him once more with its leathery trunk and again slamming him to
the ground.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The elephant will torment him for a time. Sahib. Before
the moment of death.&quot; The small brown man's eyes shone in anticipation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Again the prisoner was lifted and again dashed to
the ground. Now he no longer attempted to struggle; he merely lay moaning in a
broken voice.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then the mahout shouted something to the elephant and the
animal suddenly reared above the man, crushing down on him with both front
feet. There was a final, rending scream and then silence, as blood sprayed over
the dust. The elephant reared again, and again mashed the lifeless body. Then
again. Finally the animal placed one foot on the man's lower torso and seized
his crushed chest with its trunk, wrenching upward and rending the body in two.
Maddened by the smell of blood, he whipped the torn half upward and slammed it
once more against the hard earth. Finally the mahout tapped the blood-spattered
elephant with his <i>ankus</i> and began guiding it toward the back of the
square. The crowd, which had held a spellbound silence, erupted into cheers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That's the most brutal death I've ever seen.&quot;
Hawksworth found his voice only after the initial shock had passed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It's why so few men dare to commit murder, Sahib. But
His Majesty is very just. All criminals are given a full Islamic trial before
they are executed.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth looked up to see yet another man being led into
the plaza. The cheers of the crowd died abruptly. He wore only a loincloth,
which was pure white, and his hands were bound not behind him but in front,
secured through a large wooden clamp that had been locked together like
European stocks. Hawksworth took one look and felt his own groin tighten.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;All praise to Allah the Merciful. And to the Holy
Prophet, on whom be peace,&quot; one of the white-bearded mullahs shouted
through the silence. He wore a gray turban, a dingy collarless shirt that
reached to his knees, and over that a long black vest. He carried a staff and
was barefoot. Other mullahs clustered around him immediately and joined his
call.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Murder! Murder!&quot; Another voice began to chant,
from a young man standing near Hawksworth. Then other young men with him took
up the cry and began to surge forward. They were fresh-faced, with clean white
shirts and trousers, and they awkwardly began to brandish short swords.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Imperial guards immediately threw a line across the crowd and
held the young men back with short pikes. While the crowd watched, the prisoner
continued to walk alone and unescorted toward the center of the square.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth studied the face again, the deep sad eyes above a
flowing white beard, and there was no doubt. He turned to the man standing
beside him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Do you know who that is?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Of course, Sahib. He's the heretic poet Samad. Did you
hear that he denied the existence of Allah in an Islamic court? He has been
sentenced to death.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Who are those men with the swords?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;They're his disciples. I think they came today to try
to save him.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth turned to see the elephant again being urged
forward.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What about. . . what about the Persian woman I heard
was arrested with him?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I do not think she has been executed yet, Sahib. They
say she will be hanged, secretly, in the fort. Women are not executed by
elephant.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;When . . .&quot; Hawksworth struggled to contain his
voice. &quot;When do they say she'll be hanged?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Perhaps in a week or two. Perhaps she is already
dead.&quot; He moved forward to watch. &quot;What do poor Believers know of
justice inside the fort? But the heretic Samad will die for all to see, so
there will be no rumors that he still lives. Already there are stories in Agra
that he had escaped to Persia.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Samad had reached the center of the square. As the elephant
approached, he turned to the crowd of young men, raising his bound hands toward
them in a gesture of recognition.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Do not grieve for this weak clay.&quot; His voice was
sonorous, hypnotic, and the crowd fell curiously quiet. &quot;Grieve for yourselves,
you who must travel on a short while, sorrowing still.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The crowd erupted again, the mullahs and many others
urging his death, the young followers decrying it. Again he lifted his hands,
and his voice seemed to bring silence around it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I say to you do not grieve. You will all soon know far
greater sorrow. Soon death will lay his dark hand across the city of Agra, upon
Muslim and Hindu alike, upon woman and child. Many will perish without cause.
Therefore grieve not for me. Grieve for yourselves, when death will descend
upon your doorsteps, there to take the innocent. Sorrow for your own.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The crowd had listened in hushed silence. Then a bearded
mullah shouted &quot;Death to the heretic&quot; and others took up the cry.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Samad watched the elephant quietly as it continued to lumber
forward. When it reached him, he bowed to it with an ironic smile. The mahout
looked upward toward the black throne of the <i>Diwan-i-Khas</i>, where
Arangbar and Janahara sat waiting. Arangbar turned to the queen, with what
seemed a question, and she replied without moving her stare from the court
below. Arangbar paused a moment, then signaled the mahout to proceed. The
bearded mahout saluted the Moghul, then urged the elephant forward with his
sharp <i>ankus</i>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The elephant flapped its bloodstained ears in confusion but
did not move.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The mahout goaded it again and shouted something in its ear,
but it merely waved its trunk and trumpeted.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Merciful Allah. The elephant does not smell his
crime.&quot; The small man caught Hawksworth's questioning look. &quot;The
Great Akman believed elephants would not kill an innocent man, that they can
always smell a man's guilt. But I have never before seen one refuse to kill a
prisoner. I think Samad must be a wizard, who has entranced the animal.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Innocent,&quot; a young man from the group of disciples
yelled out above the silence.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The mahout goaded the elephant once more, but still it stood
unmoving.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;Innocent.&quot; More cries went up from
Samad's young followers, and again they pressed forward, swords in hand. In
moments the plaza became a battleground, blood staining the earth as the
Imperial guards began turning their pikes against the line of disciples. Then
others in the crowd, mullahs leading them, broke through and joined the battle
against the young men. Sword rang against sword and calls to Allah rent the
air.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Samad stood quietly watching as the battle edged toward him.
Then suddenly a group of bearded mullahs broke from the crowd and surged toward
him, swords drawn. Hawksworth instinctively reached for his own weapon, but the
man beside him caught his arm. He looked down to see a small, rust-handled <i>katar
</i>pointed against his chest.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;This is the will of Allah. An infidel must not
interfere.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The mullahs had formed a ring around Samad. He stood
silently, waiting, as the leader stepped forward and thrust a long sword into
the bare skin of his lower stomach. He jerked but did not fall, standing tall
as another swung a sharp blade across his open neck. His head dropped to one
side and he slumped forward, as two more men thrust swords into his belly. In
seconds he disappeared beneath a crowd of black cloaks.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>From a low latticework window down the east side of the Red
Fort, past the Jasmine Tower and many levels down the Khas Mahal, it was just
possible to see the center of the plaza. A woman stood by the window watching
as the crowd turned on the young men and, one by one, cut them down. Then she
saw a bloodstained body being hoisted above a black-cloaked assembly and
carried triumphantly toward the river gate.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>There had been tears as Shirin watched. But as she turned
away, toward the darkness of the cell, her eyes were hard and dry.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>       
Hawksworth waited anxiously by the rear entryway of the <i>Diwan-i-Khas </i>and
watched the three Jesuits file silently through the tapestried archway beside
him. Father Alvarez Sarmento, imperious in his freshly laundered black habit,
moved directly to the silver railing that circled the throne. The old priest's
eyes seemed to fairly glow in triumph. Behind him trailed Father Pinheiro and
the pudgy father Francisco da Silva, their attempts at poise marred by
shifting, anxious glances of disquiet. Hawksworth studied all three and puzzled
even more what could be afoot.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Over a week had passed since the death of Samad, and since
that day he had no longer been invited to Arangbar's evenings in the <i>Diwan-i-Khas</i>.
Even his requests for an audience had been ignored. Before the poet's death, it
had been possible for him to believe that the absurdity of Samad and Shirin's
arrest would eventually <i>Resolve</i> itself, that the nightmare would fade
into reality and bring their release. But the killing of Samad had blotted out
that illusion. When he saw Arangbar, presiding high above the square, signal
the Sufi's death, he had realized finally the nightmare was all too real. Since
that time he had spent the sleepless nights alone, distraught, counting the
passage of each hour as he awaited news Shirin was also dead. In his mind he
had conceived a dozen stratagems to try to save her, a dozen arguments,
threats, bargains for her release, but nothing could be done if he was denied
even an audience with the Moghul.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>That they should have tasted so much, only to lose it all. He
found himself aware, for the first time ever, how much he could want, could
need, a woman like Shirin beside him. With her, life itself seemed renewed. She
was like no other he had ever known: strong, beautiful, self-willed. He had
found himself admiring the last most of all, even though he still found it
startling. But the love he had known with her in his arms now only made the
despair deeper. Nothing was left. Now there was only abiding sorrow, loss
beyond healing. She had given him something he had never known, something he
realized—for the first time ever—he no longer wanted to live without. He would
have taken he</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>r place</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> a hundred times over, but even that
seemed impossible.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then, that morning, hope had appeared, almost a miracle., A
sudden, urgent message had been delivered, instructing him to appear once more
in the <i>Diwan-i-Khas</i>. It almost certainly meant Arangbar had received
word of the English fleet. If Shirin were still alive, and there had been no
news of her death, it must mean that the Moghul was uncertain about her guilt:
he was not a man who normally waited to act. And if she was alive, all things
again became possible . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He had asked himself again and again over the past week why
he had suddenly been forgotten by Arangbar. He finally concluded it was the
distracting turmoil that had gripped Agra and the court since Samad's death.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The Sufi's last words had been repeated throughout the city,
and already there were rumors of impending calamity: the bazaars were alive
with talk of a Persian Safavid invasion from the northwest, a rebellion among
the Imperial guards, an impending holocaust that would burn all Agra to ash, a
universal plague. The streets had an apocalyptic air, with omens foreseen in
every temple.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Another reason for Arangbar's preoccupation could be the
rumors from the south. Word was sweeping Agra that Prince Jadar and his army
had been savaged by the Deccani forces and were now retreating northward, with
Malik Ambar in pursuit. If this story were true, then the Abyssinian's defeat
of Jadar must have been overwhelming, since rebels did not normally pursue
Moghul forces. But this story was still merely rumor. There had been no actual
reports of any engagements in the south.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Jadar's possible defeat, so the talk in Agra went, had gone
very heavily with Arangbar, and accounted for his increasing dependence on
opium and wine. Those who had seen him reported the Moghul was growing
noticeably weaker. And as his strength waned, so too did his authority. Ever
since the night of the wedding, Queen Janahara had been moving to assume more
and more of the prerogatives of power. Arangbar already seemed to be becoming a
figurehead. The only sanctuary she had not yet invaded was the <i>Diwan-i-Khas</i>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Those evening gatherings Arangbar still ruled like a god, and
the unusual note he had sent to Hawksworth was worded almost more like an order
than an invitation. It confirmed vividly the reports that Arangbar was growing
more erratic by the day.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Around Hawksworth sat the usual assembly of Arangbar's
closest advisers, men whose perpetually smiling faces he had come to know well
over the past weeks. Prominent among them as always was Nadir Sharif, who now
seemed to be avoiding Hawksworth's glance. Also in attendance was a special
contingent of Rajput guards, in Imperial turbans and tunics. Hawksworth could
never remember having seen these particular guards in the <i>Diwan-i-Khas </i>before.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>When the last official had arrived, the Rajput guards moved
across the doorway and the kettledrum was sounded. Moments later the tapestry
behind the throne was pushed aside by two eunuchs and Arangbar emerged into the
light. He stumbled momentarily on the edge of a carpet, then recovered his
balance and took his seat on the white marble throne. His dull eyes glistened
against the lamplight as the men in the room dropped to <i>teslim</i>. For the
first time he seemed more annoyed than amused when Hawksworth failed to bow to
the carpet. He glared at him for a long moment and then spoke to Nadir Sharif,
who stood waiting by his side. The prime minister turned to the room.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Ambassador Hawksworth, His Majesty commands you to come
forward.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It was abrupt language rarely heard in the <i>Diwan-i-Khas</i>,
and the room immediately fell silent. Hawksworth rose and tightened his belt,
feeling his apprehension rising. As he neared the throne, he found himself
seeing not Arangbar's expressionless gaze, but the face of Shirin as she waited
for help.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Inglish, stand there.&quot; He pointed to the side of
the throne opposite the Jesuits. &quot;Tell me, any fresh news of your king's
fleet?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth felt his heart explode, realizing there was no
arrival—and no possibility of using King James's presents to bargain for
Shirin. &quot;I expect it any day, Your Majesty. Possibly the winds have been
against them.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The winds.&quot; Arangbar turned to Father Sarmento,
his voice sarcastic. &quot;Do you think the winds have been against them,
Padre?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Undoubtedly, Majesty.&quot; Sarmento could not suppress
a</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>malicious
smile. &quot;The winds of truth. They have been arrested in a gale of
deception.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I object, Your Majesty, to this Papist's
innuendos.&quot; Hawksworth felt himself suddenly bristle. &quot;An Englishman
does not accept insults from a Portugal.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You will listen quietly to what you are about to hear,
Inglish, or you will be removed by my guards.&quot; Arangbar again turned to
Father Sarmento. &quot;Padre, repeat to the Inglish conspirator what you told
me this afternoon.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;May it please Your Majesty, not only is the English a
heretic before God and the Holy Church, he is also a liar.&quot; Sarmento
paused with the dramatic timing of a practiced orator. &quot; There is no
English fleet.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth stared at the Jesuit in speechless dismay. His
entire being seemed to crash down about him as Sarmento continued.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Because of the foresight of His Excellency, Miguel
Vaijantes, Viceroy of Goa, we have now uncovered the truth, Your Majesty. After
his patrols encountered no English merchantmen, either north or south, he began
to grow suspicious. He ordered his personal guards to find and detain the man
who claimed to have intercepted Jadar's cipher reporting the fleet. The traitor
was found, not surprisingly, in a Goan brothel, where he had been for many
days, spending more money than such a man could normally earn in a lifetime. He
was brought to the palace and interrogated on the <i>strappado</i>.&quot;
Sarmento turned triumphantly to Hawksworth. &quot;Where he readily admitted
being paid to bring a false report.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And who do you believe paid him?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;On that His Excellency is still uncertain, Your
Majesty. He was paid by agents in the south.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But who does the Viceroy believe paid the money?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The coins were assayed and traced to the mint at Surat,
Your Majesty. They were part of a special minting that took place just before
the English, Hawksworth, left the city. The assay also revealed they were a
debased alloy, slightly lower in silver content than is normal, although not
enough to be readily detectable. Similar coins have begun to be used throughout
the Deccan. Reportedly they were given out recently by Prince Jadar as back pay
to the troops of certain <i>mansabdars</i>.'&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Who were the coins minted for?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The Shahbandar at Surat, Mirza Nuruddin, claims to have
misplaced the records for this particular minting. However, he maintains the
lower silver content was probably due to a minter's oversight. The former
governor of Surat, Mukarrab Khan, is returning to the city to investigate. The
minting run appears to have been approximately fifty lakhs of rupees. But the
actual silver content was only forty-nine lakhs of rupees.&quot; He paused for
breath. &quot;The Shahbandar says he has no idea what could have happened to
the other lakh's worth of silver bullion authorized to be used in the
minting.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That's not so difficult to explain, knowing Mirza
Nuruddin.&quot; Arangbar seemed to be talking to himself. Then he glanced again
at Sarmento. &quot;Of course, the discrepancy would probably never have been
detected if the coins given to the traitor had not been melted down and
assayed. The question remains who ordered him paid?&quot; Arangbar turned to
Hawksworth, who stood with his mind churning, refusing to accept the
consequences of what he was hearing. It meant the end of everything.
&quot;Perhaps the Inglish ambassador can help explain it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I have no idea why there was a false report, Majesty. I
believed it too.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Did you, Inglish?&quot; Arangbar glared down drunkenly
from his throne. &quot;Or did you plot this with Prince Jadar when you met with
him in Burhanpur? Did you and he conspire together to deceive me, exchanging
bribes in the pocket of the prince with some of this debased silver coin for
his help in a ruse you thought would produce a <i>firman </i>when brought to my
ears?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I gave nothing to the prince, Majesty. And I asked
nothing from him. That is the truth.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The truth from you is not always easy to obtain,
Inglish. Your deceptions have distressed me very much. And, curiously enough.
Her Majesty even more. There is no fleet, Inglish. Instead there are lies, by
you and, I'm beginning to suspect now, by my own son. I no longer have any idea
what he is doing in the south. But I fear his arrogance has brought ruin to his
army. I am recalling him to Agra, immediately, for an inquiry, and I am hereby
ordering you to leave India.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth noticed Nadir Sharif shoot a troubled glance
toward the Jesuits.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;May it please Your Majesty, neither I nor my king have
had anything to do with the reports of the fleet, whether true or false. There
will be other voyages and soon. My king has promised it, and he is a sovereign
who honors his word.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Your Inglish king posts a conspirator and a traitor to
my court. He will never have a <i>firman </i>from my hand, no matter how many
voyages he may send.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;If there is indeed no fleet now, then I agree
Your Majesty has been deceived. But I have been also. We have both been used by
those around us, for purposes unknown. But my king would not knowingly play
false with Your Majesty. Nor would I. Those who would deceive you, whoever they
may be, sit much closer to Your Majesty's throne.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It is not you</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
 color:windowtext'>r place</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>,
Inglish, to tell me mine is a court of liars. Your forgeries in India are
ended. You will be gone from Agra within the week, or I will not answer for
your life. After that you no longer may use the title of ambassador. You will
be treated as the conspirator you are. And as of this moment you are stripped
of your title of khan.&quot; He motioned to the Rajput guards. &quot;Take him
away.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth turned to see Father Sarmento beaming.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Alas it seems we soon must part, Ambassador. May God in
His mercy grant you a pleasant and speedy journey. Should you wish to travel
through Goa, I can give you a letter to His Excellency, Miguel Vaijantes,
requesting safe passage on a westbound galleon.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Damn your Viceroy.&quot; As Hawksworth turned back
toward Arangbar, he felt rough hands close about his arms. Before he could
speak, he was being guided through the rear doorway and into the long gallery
leading to the public square.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Majesty.&quot; Nadir Sharif watched the curtains close
behind</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Hawksworth,
then rose and moved closer to the throne. &quot;May it please you, the
Englishman unfortunately remains my guest. At least for a few more days. As his
host I feel a trifling obligation to see he finds his way home safely. I ask
leave to excuse myself for a few moments to ensure he finds a palanquin.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;As you wish.&quot; Arangbar was watching a eunuch bring
in a box of opium.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>When Nadir Sharif moved toward the doorway, Father Pinheiro
rose unobtrusively and slipped out behind him. As the Jesuit moved into the
hallway, he appeared not to hurry, but his brisk walk brought him alongside the
prime minister midway down the corridor.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Have you told Her Majesty, as we agreed?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Told her what?&quot; Nadir Sharif did not break his
pace or remove his eyes from Hawksworth, still being led by the guards several
yards ahead.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;About the ship that would be seized.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Nadir Sharif stopped as though hit by an arrow. &quot;But
surely you'll not take the vessel now! Didn't you see that the Englishman has
been ordered out of Agra? He's finished. There'll certainly be no trading <i>firman
</i>for him now, or ever.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But the warships were dispatched from Surat day before
yesterday, just before the pigeons arrived from Goa with the word of the hoax.
His Excellency, Miguel Vaijantes', message revoking their order to sail arrived
a day too late. They were already at sea. The Indian ship may have already been
seized.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Nadir Sharif inspected him with astonishment. &quot;Your
Viceroy must be mad. To take the vessel now? There's no purpose in it. His
Majesty will be most annoyed.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But you were the one who suggested it!&quot; The
Jesuit's voice rose, quivering in dismay. &quot;You said that bold measures
were for bold men. Those were your words. His Excellency agreed it would be a
decisive stroke of firmness.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And what does Father Sarmento think of this
folly?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Father Sarmento does not yet know. I thought it best
not to inform him.&quot; Pinheiro's eyes were despairing. &quot;What did Her
Majesty, Queen Janahara, say about the plan?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What do you mean?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We agreed you would tell her.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I've not forgotten our agreement. I've been watching
carefully for the right moment.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;She does not even know!&quot; Pinheiro seized his arm
and stared at him incredulously. &quot;But I told His Excellency you would-“</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I planned to tell her any day. The time was
approaching. But now, given what has happened . . .&quot; Then he smiled and
touched the Jesuit's arm lightly. &quot;But I think she can still bring reason
to His Majesty. It can all be readily explained as a misunderstanding.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But you must tell her immediately.&quot; Pinheiro's
shock was growing. &quot;If she hears of it before you've explained, she'll
think –-“</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Of course. But there's no reason yet for concern.&quot;
Nadir Sharif smiled again. &quot;I assure you it all can be handled very
routinely. But please tell His Excellency, Miguel Vaijantes, not to do anything
else this ill-advised for at least a week. I can only excuse so much at one
time.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As Nadir Sharif turned to continue down the corridor,
Pinheiro reached out and seized his arm again. &quot;You must also do one other
thing. You must make sure the Englishman is removed from Agra immediately. We
both know His Majesty may well forget by tomorrow that he has ordered him
gone.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;This time I doubt very much His Majesty will forget. It
will only be a matter of days, in any case.&quot; Nadir Sharif turned and
smiled. &quot;And remember what I told you, that as far as His Majesty is
concerned, I know nothing about your Viceroy's impetuous act. But I do advise
you to inform Father Sarmento, before he hears it in open <i>durbar</i>.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;He'll be furious. He'll probably order me back
to Goa.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I doubt it. I'm sure he knows your value here.&quot;
Nadir Sharif turned without another word and hurried on down the corridor.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Ahead of him Hawksworth was being led by the guards through
the marble archways. As they reached the end, facing the doorway leading to the
courtyard stairs, he turned one last time and stared back, seeing Nadir Sharif
for the first time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What do you want now? My money or my life? Or both?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I merely came to see you safely home, Ambassador.&quot;
Nadir Sharif waved the guards back toward the <i>Diwan-i-Khas</i>, and they
bowed with relief as they turned to retreat. &quot;And to offer my
condolences.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And no doubt to cozen me as well. I intend to find out
who played me false. Even if it's Jadar. Somebody has hell to pay.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That would be most unwise, Ambassador. I'm afraid we
were all a bit too credulous. I readily confess even I had begun to believe
your story.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It wasn't 'my story'! I knew nothing about . . .&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But you never denied it, Ambassador. Surely you knew
the truth all along. The truth is always wisest. That's my cardinal rule in
life.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But it could have been true. It was entirely possible.
Why didn't you explain that to Arangbar? You're still supposed to be my
agent.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That would be rather difficult for His Majesty to
believe, given what really happened. But I do suppose it's possible.&quot;
Nadir Sharif patted Hawksworth's shoulder. &quot;I'll see if there's anything I
can do. But in the meantime, I suggest you begin preparations to leave. His
Majesty was unusually disturbed tonight.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;He's disturbed over a lot of things, most of which have
little to do with me.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;If you mean the matter of the prince, I assure you it's
alarming to us all. No one is certain what has happened in the south. In fact,
you were one of the last men to see Prince Jadar. He seems almost to have
disappeared. All sorts of rumors are working their way to the court. Where it
will end no one can any longer even guess.&quot; Nadir Sharif followed
Hawksworth out into the open square of the <i>Diwan-i-Am</i>.
&quot;Incidentally, Ambassador, did you yourself know anything about the fifty
lakhs of silver coin spoken of tonight?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth examined him a moment. &quot;Maybe the Shahbandar
stole it all.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That's hardly an answer, Ambassador. It wasn't, by any
chance, traveling with you from Surat to Burhanpur? You know, His Majesty has
demanded a full investigation. I think he may just summon Mirza Nuruddin to
Agra for an explanation.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then let him ask Mirza Nuruddin what happened. I'm sure
he'll get the truth.&quot; Hawksworth turned toward the large gate at the far
end of the square.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Very well, Ambassador.&quot; Nadir Sharif smiled
warmly. &quot;By the way, I understand Mirza Nuruddin has suggested you may
have smuggled it out of Surat yourself, leaving a worthless letter of credit,
in order to swindle your merchants.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The bastard.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The truth will surely come out, Ambassador, as you say.
So I wish you good night and a restful sleep.&quot; Nadir Sharif turned and in
moments had melted into the darkness.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth slowly worked his way down the cobblestone
roadway, past the guards at the Amar Singh Gate, and into the Agra night. He
turned left and headed toward the banks of the Jamuna, hoping the smells and
sounds of water would soothe his mind. When he reached the riverbank, he found
himself looking back at the massive walls of the Red Fort, wondering again
where Shirin was being kept, wanting to be with her. To hold her one last time.
But the high stone walls stood dark and mute as his own despair.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You are home, Sahib.&quot; The servants were waiting,
beaming and immaculate in fresh muslin <i>dhotis</i>, as Hawksworth pushed open
the doors of his compound. It was nearing midnight. &quot;Your house is honored
tonight with a special evening.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What are you planning? My farewell?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The servants examined him uncomprehending as he pushed past
the portiere of the doorway.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The room was heavy with sandalwood incense. In the lamplight
he recognized Kamala's musicians: the gray-haired flautist in a long <i>lungi </i>wrap
and bare to the waist, the drummer smiling widely in a plain white shirt and
brown <i>dhoti</i>. Although he had not seen them for days, they paused only
briefly to acknowledge him. The drummer was absorbed in tuning his instrument,
using a small hammer to tap blocks of wood wedged beneath the leather thongs
securing the drumhead. As he adjusted the tension on the thongs, he
periodically tested the drum's pitch against a note from the flute.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Kamala was nowhere to be seen. Hawksworth stared about the
room quizzically, then turned to the musicians. They responded with a puzzled
shrug and motioned toward a rear door.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;She summoned them here tonight, Sahib. She did not tell
them why. No one has seen her all day. It is very worrying.&quot; The servant
shuffled uneasily. &quot;Has the Sahib heard the stories in the bazaar?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What stories?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>From behind the curtains came the sudden tinkling of tiny
bells. The musicians smiled in recognition.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As the servants edged toward the curtained doorway to look,
Hawksworth extracted a half-empty bottle of brandy from his chest and threw
himself down against a bolster.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>What's this all about? Why can't I be alone for once? Tonight
of all nights she does this.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He puzzled a moment over Kamala, her erratic and powerful
moods, then his thoughts returned gloomily to the <i>Diwan-i-Khas </i>and to
Shirin. He could not give up hope. Never. He never gave up hope.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>There was another tinkling of bells and the curtain at the
doorway was swept aside. Standing there, jewels afire in the lamplight, was
Kamala.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He noticed the two musicians stare at her for an instant,
then exchange quick, disturbed glances.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She was, it seemed, more striking than he had ever seen her.
Her eyes were seductively lined with <i>kohl </i>and her lips were an inviting
red, matching the large dot on her forehead. In one side of her nose she wore a
small ring studded with diamonds. Her hair was swept back and secured with rows
of rubies and her throat and arms were circled with bands of gold imbedded with
small green emeralds. She wore a silken wrap folded in pleats about each leg in
a way that enhanced the full curve of her hips. Her waist was circled by a belt
of beaten gold, and her palms and the soles of her feet had been reddened with
henna. As she came toward him, the bands of tiny bells at her ankles punctuated
the sensuous sway of her breasts beneath her silk halter.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You've returned early. I'm glad.&quot; As she moved
into the light, he thought he caught a glimpse of some profound melancholy in
her eyes. He also noted her voice was strangely frail.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Is there supposed to be a ceremony tonight I didn't
know about?&quot; As Hawksworth studied her, he took another long swallow of
brandy, its heat burning away at his anguish.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;This is a special evening. I have decided to dance
Bharata Natyam one last time, for Lord Shiva.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What do you mean, one last time?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She seemed to stare past him for a moment, then she slowly
turned. &quot;I'm truly glad you've come. To be here tonight. I would have
waited for you, but there was no time. And I wondered if you would really understand.
Perhaps I was wrong. Bharata Natyam is never only for the dancer. So it is good
you are here. Perhaps it was meant to be. Perhaps you can understand something
of what I feel tonight.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I haven't understood much that's happened tonight so
far.&quot; Hawksworth settled his brandy bottle awkwardly onto the carpet and
forced himself to bring her into focus.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You do not seem yourself, my <i>feringhi </i>Sahib.&quot;
She studied him for a moment. &quot;Did you hear sad news of your Persian
woman?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Nothing. But I'm afraid I've just lost my best chance
to save her.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I don't understand.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It's not your trouble.&quot; He examined her wistfully.
&quot;It seems I'll be leaving Agra sooner than I thought. So dance if you
want, and then I'll wish you well.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Your trouble is always my trouble.&quot; She frowned as
she studied him. &quot;But you are leaving? So soon?&quot; She seemed not to
wait for an answer as she went on. &quot;Never mind, I've never understood the
affairs of ambassadors and kings. But our parting must not be sad. Let my dance
to Shiva be my farewell to you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She turned and signaled to the flautist, who began a low-
pitched, poignant melody. &quot;Have you ever seen the Bharata Natyam?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Never.&quot; Hawksworth sipped more brandy from the
bottle and found himself wishing he could send them all away and play a suite
on his lute, the one he had played for Shirin that day at the observatory.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then it may be difficult for you to comprehend at
first. With my body and my song I will tell Lord Shiva of my longing for him.
Do you think you can understand it?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'll try.&quot; Hawksworth looked up at her and again
sensed some great sadness in her eyes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She examined him silently for a moment. &quot;But I want you
to understand. Not the words I sing, they're in ancient Sanskrit, but if you
watch my hands, they will also speak. I will sing to Lord Shiva, but I give
life to his song with my eyes, my hands, my body. I will re-create the poem
with my dance. My eyes will speak the desire of my heart. The language of my
hands will tell my longing for Lord Shiva. My feet will show the rhythms by
which he brings order to the world. If you will try to feel what I feel,
perhaps Lord Shiva will touch you and lighten your burden.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And this is called Bharata Natyam? What does that
mean?&quot; Hawksworth slipped off his mud-smeared boots and wearily tossed
them next to the carpet.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The ancient temple dance of India is Bharata Natyam:
bhava means mood, raga means song, tala means rhythm. All these are brought
together in the dance. Natyam means the merging of dance and story. The true
Bharata Natyam has seven movements: some are called pure dance and these are
only rhythms, but some also tell a story. If I were to dance them all, as I
would in the temple, I would have to dance all night.&quot; She tried wanly to
smile. &quot;But not now. Tonight I am not so strong. Tonight I will dance only
the Varnam, the most important movement. In it I will tell the story of how the
goddess Parvati, Shiva's beloved consort, longs for her lord. If I dance well I
will become Parvati, and through the story of her love for Shiva, I will tell
my own.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;So it's really just a love song?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It is Parvati's song of longing for her lord. The words
are very simple.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>&quot;Great
with love for you this night.</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Am I, oh
Lord.</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Do not
avert yourself from me. </span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Do not
tease me, do not scorn me,</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Oh great,
oh beautiful God </span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Of the
Brihadishwari temple. </span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Great God
who gives release </span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>From the
sorrows of the world . . .&quot;</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Kamala paused to tighten the straps securing the bells around
her ankles. &quot;The song goes on to say that she cannot bear even to hear the
voice of the nightingale now that she is separated from her Lord Shiva. She
cannot endure the dark night now that he has taken himself from her.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It's a very touching love song.&quot; Hawksworth found
himself thinking again of Shirin, and of the dark nights they had both endured.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It is really much more. You see, Lord Shiva is her
beloved, but he is also her god. So her song also praises the beauty of the
great Shiva in all his many aspects: as her own consort, as one who has the
Third Eye of Knowledge, as the great God of the Dance, Nataraj. Through my
dance I will show all the many aspects of Shiva—as creator, as destroyer, as
lord of the cosmic rhythms of life.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth watched in groggy fascination as she rose and,
clasping her hands above her head, bowed toward a small bronze statue of the
Dancing Shiva she had placed on a corner table. Then, as the drummer took up a
steady cadence and the flute began a searching, high-pitched lament, she struck
a statuesque pose of her own, feet crossed, arms above her head. Gradually her
eyes began to dart seductively from side to side, growing in power until it
seemed her entire body might explode. Abruptly she assumed a second pose,
reminiscent of the statue. As the drummer's rhythms slowly increased, she began
to follow them with her body, next with her feet, slapping heel, then ball,
fiercely against the carpet. The drummer began to call out his bols, the
strokes he was sounding on the drum, and as he did she matched his rhythms with
the rows of tiny bells around her ankles.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth found himself being drawn into her dance. Her
rhythms were not flamboyant like those of the Kathak style, but rather seemed
to duplicate some deep natural cadence, as she returned again and again to the
pose of the Dancing Shiva. It was pure dance, and he slowly began to feel the
power of her controlled sensuality.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Without warning she began a brief song to Shiva in a high-
pitched, repetitive refrain. As she sang, her hands formed the signs for woman,
for beauty, for desire, for dozens of other words and ideas Hawksworth could
not decipher. Yet her expressive eyes exquisitely translated many of the hand
signs, while her body left no mistaking the intensity of their emotion.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>When the song and its mime reached some climactic plateau,
she suddenly resumed the pure dance, with the drummer once more reciting the
bols as he sounded them. Again she matched his rhythms perfectly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>After a time she began another verse of the song. By her mime
Hawksworth concluded she was describing some aspect of Lord Shiva. When the
song concluded, the drummer called out more <i>bols </i>and again she danced
only his rhythms. Then she began yet another verse of the song, followed by
still more rhythmic dance. The aspects of Shiva that she created all seemed
different. Some wise, some fierce, some clearly of a beauty surpassing words.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As Hawksworth watched, he began to sense some alien power
growing around him, enveloping him and his despair, just as she had said.
Kamala seemed to be gradually merging with an energy far beyond herself, almost
as though she had invoked some primal rhythm of life into existence. And as he
watched the growing intensity of her dance he began to experience a deep,
almost primitive sense of fear, a stark knowledge of life and death beyond
words.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He found himself fighting to resist the force of some
malevolent evil settling about the room, beginning to possess it and all it
contained. He felt its power begin to draw out his own life, hungry and
insistent, terrifying. And still she danced on, now only rhythms, her body
dipping and whirling, her arms everywhere at once, her smile frozen in an
ecstatic trance.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Forcing himself at last to turn away, he looked toward the
musicians. They seemed entranced by her as well, captured by the delirium of
her dance. He finally caught the eye of the drummer and weakly signaled him to
stop. But the man stared as though not comprehending, spellbound. Her dance had
now grown to a frenzy, surpassing human limits.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Summoning his last strength, he tried to pull himself up off
the bolster, but he discovered his legs were no longer his own. The room had
become a whirling pattern of color and sound, beyond all control.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Uncertainly he turned and began to feel about the carpet for
his boots. His grip closed about a sheath of soft leather and he probed inside.
There, strapped and still loaded, was his remaining pocket pistol. Shakily he
took it in his hand, checked the prime, and began trying to aim at the long
drum resting between the musicians. Now the drum seemed to drift back and forth
in his vision, while the players smiled at him with glazed eyes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He heard a hiss and felt his hand fly upward, as though
unconnected to his body. Then the world around erupted in smoke and flying
splinters of wood.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The shot had been timed perfectly with the end of a rhythm
cycle, as the drum exploded into fragments on the sum.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The smoky room was suddenly gripped in silence. The musicians
stared wildly for a moment, then threw themselves face down on the carpet,
pleading in unknown words needing no translation. Hawksworth looked in
confusion at the smoking pistol in his hand, not recognizing it. Then he threw
it onto the carpet and turned toward Kamala.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She was gazing at him with open, vacant eyes, as though
awakened suddenly from a powerful dream. Her breath was coming in short bursts,
and her skin seemed afire. She stood motionless for a moment, then tried to
move toward him, holding out her arms. After two hesitant steps, she crumpled
to the carpet.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>When he bolted upward to reach for her, the servants were
there, holding him back.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You must not touch her, Sahib.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But she's . . .&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;No, Sahib.&quot; They gripped his arms tighter.
&quot;Can't you see? She has the sickness.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What are you talking about?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It began late today, in the bazaar. Perhaps they do not
know of it yet in the fort. At first no one realized what it was. But tonight,
while she was dancing, one of the slaves from Sharif Sahib's kitchen came to
tell us. Two of the eunuchs and five of his servants have become very
sick.&quot; He paused to look at Kamala. &quot;I think she must have known.
That is why she wanted to dance tonight.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Knew what? What did she know?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The plague, Sahib. The slave who came said that the
plague has struck all over Agra. It has never happened in India before.&quot;
The servant paused. &quot;It is the will of Allah. The prophet Samad foretold
it. Now it has come.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth turned again to Kamala. She was still watching him
with empty, expressionless eyes, as though her life had just poured out of her.
He looked down at her for a moment, then reached for a pillow and carefully
slipped it beneath her head. Her lips moved as she tried to form words, but at
first no sound came. Then, as though again finding some strength beyond
herself, her voice came in a whisper.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Did you see?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What . . . ?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Did you see him? The Great God Shiva. He came tonight.
And danced beside me. Did you see his beauty?&quot; She paused to breathe, then
her voice rose again, full and warm. &quot;He was as I knew he would be.
Beautiful beyond telling. He danced in a ring of fire, with his hair streaming
out in burning strands. He came as Shiva the Destroyer. But his dance was so
beautiful. So very, very beautiful.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText2>From the <span style='font-style:normal'>Tuzuk-i-Arangbari,
the court chronicles of His Imperial Majesty</span>:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>“On the day of Mubarak-shamba, the twenty-eighth of the month
of Dai, there came first reports of the pestilence in the city of Agra. On this
day over five hundred people were stricken.</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The first signs are headache and fever and much bleeding at
the nose. After this the </span></i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>dana
<i>of the plague, buboes, form under the armpits, or in the groin, or below the
throat. The infected ones turn in color from yellow inclining to black. They
vomit and endure much high fever and pain. And then they die.</i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>If one in a household contracts the pestilence and dies,
others in the same house inevitably follow after, traveling the same road of
annihilation. Those in whom the buboes appeared, if they call another person
for water to drink or wash, will also infect the latter with the sirayat, the
infection. It has come to pass that, through excessive apprehension, none will
minister unto those infected.</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent3>It has become known from men of great age and from
old histories that this disease has never before shown itself in this land of
Hindustan. Many physicians and learned men have been questioned as to its
cause. Some say it has come because there has been drought for two years in
succession; others say it is owing to the corruption of the air. Some attribute
it to other causes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The infection is now spreading to all towns and villages in
the region of Agra save one, the noble city of the Great Akman, Fatehpur.</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Brian Hawksworth walked slowly up worn stone steps leading
from the riverside funeral ghats. The pathway was narrow, crowded, and lined
with carved statues of Hindu gods: a roly-poly god with human form and the head
of an elephant, a god with a lion's body and a grotesquely grinning human face,
an austere deity with a pointed head and a trident in his hand. All were
ancient, weathered, ill-kept. Tame monkeys, small, brown, malicious, chased
among them screeching.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The smoke from the <i>ghats </i>behind him still seared in
his lungs. Only when he reached the top of the steps could he force himself to
look back. Scavenger birds wheeled in the sky above and small barks with single
oarsmen plied the muddy face of the Jamuna. Along the banks were toiling
washermen, Untouchables, who wore nothing save a brown loincloth and a kerchief
over their heads. They stood in a long row, knee-deep at the water's edge,
mechanically slapping folded lengths of cloth against stacks of flat stones.
They seemed unconcerned by the nearness of the funeral ghats, stone platforms
at the river's edge that were built out above the steps leading down into the
water. As he silently surveyed the crowd around him, from somewhere on the
street above a voice chanted a funeral litany: Ram Nam Sach Hai, the Name of
Ram Is Truth Itself.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial;color:windowtext'> </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It had taken four days for Kamala to die. The morning after
she had danced, she had begun to show unmistakable symptoms of the plague. She
had called for Brahmin priests and, seating herself on a wooden plank in their
presence, had removed her <i>todus</i>, the ear pendants that were the mark of
her <i>devadasi </i>caste, and placed them together with twelve gold coins on
the plank before her. It was her deconsecration. Then with a look of infinite
peace, she had announced she was ready to die.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Next she informed the priests that since she had no sons in
Agra, no family at all, she wanted Brian Hawksworth to officiate at her
funeral. He had not understood what she wanted until the servants whispered it
to him. The Brahmins had been scandalized and at first had refused to agree,
insisting he had no caste and consequently was a despicable Untouchable.
Finally, after more payments, they had reluctantly consented. Then she had
turned to him and explained what she had done.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>When he tried to argue, she had appealed to him in the name
of Shiva.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I only ask you do this one last thing for me,&quot; she
had said, going on to insist his responsibilities would not be difficult.
&quot;There are Hindu servants in the palace. Though they are low caste, they
know enough Turki to guide you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>After the Brahmins had departed, she called the servants and,
as Hawksworth watched, ordered them to remove all her jewels from the rosewood
box where she kept them. Then she asked him to accompany them as they took the
jewels through the Hindu section of Agra, to a temple of the goddess Mari, who
presides over epidemics. They were to donate all her jewels to the goddess.
Smiling at Hawksworth's astonishment, she had explained that Hindus believe a
person's reincarnation is directly influenced by the amount of alms given in
his or her previous life. This last act of charity might even bring her back as
a Brahmin.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Two days later she lapsed into a delirium of fever. As death
drew near, the Hindu servants again summoned the priests to visit the palace.
The plague was spreading now, and with it fear, and at first none had been
willing to comply. Only after it was agreed that they would be paid three times
the usual price for the ceremonies did the Brahmins come. They had laid
Kamala's body on a bed of <i>kusa </i>grass in the open air, sprinkled her head
with water brought from the sacred Ganges River, and smeared her brow with
Ganges clay. She had seemed only vaguely conscious of what they were doing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>When at last she died, her body was immediately washed,
perfumed, and bedecked with flowers. Then she was wrapped in linen, lifted onto
a bamboo bier, and carried toward the river ghats by the Hindu servants,
winding through the streets with her body held above their heads, intoning a
funeral dirge. Hawksworth had led the procession, carrying a firepot with
sacred fire provided by Nadir Sharifs Hindu servants.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The riverside was already crowded with mourners, for there
had been many deaths, and the air was acrid from the smoke of cremation pyres.
On the steps above the ghats was a row of thatch umbrellas, and sitting on a
reed mat beneath each was a Brahmin priest. All were shirtless, potbellied, and
wore three stripes of white clay down their forehead in honor of Vishnu's
trident. The servants approached one of the priests and began to bargain with
him. After a time the man rose and signified agreement. The servants whispered
to Hawksworth that he was there to provide funeral rites for hire, adding with
some satisfaction that Brahmins who served at the ghats were despised as
mercenaries by the rest of their caste.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>After the bargain had been struck, the priest retired beneath
his umbrella to watch while they purchased logs from vendors and began
construction of a pyre. When finished, it was small, no more than three feet
high, and irregular; but no one seemed to care. Satisfied, they proceeded to
douse it with oil.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then the Brahmin priest was summoned from his umbrella and he
rose and came down the steps, bowing to a stone Shiva lingam as he passed.
After he had performed a short ceremony, chanting from the Vedas, the winding
sheet was cut away and Kamala's body was lifted atop the stack of wood.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>A mortal sadness had swept through Hawksworth as he stood
holding the torch, listening to the Brahmin chant and studying the flow of the
river. He thought again of Kamala, of the times he had secretly admired her
erotic bearing, the times she had sat patiently explaining how best to draw the
long sensuous notes from his new sitar, the times he had held her in his arms.
And he thought again of their last evening, when she had danced with the power
of a god.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>When at last he moved toward the bier, the servants had
touched his arm and pointed him toward her feet, explaining that only if the
deceased were a man could the pyre be lighted at the head.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The oil-soaked logs had kindled quickly, sending out the
sweet smoke of <i>neem</i>. Soon the pyre was nothing but yellow tongues of
fire, and for a moment he thought he glimpsed her once more, in among the
flames, dancing as the goddess Parvati, the beloved consort of Shiva.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>When he turned to walk away, the servants had caught his
sleeve and indicated he must remain. As her &quot;son&quot; it was his duty to
ensure that the heat burst her skull, releasing her soul. Otherwise he would
have to do it himself.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He waited, the smoke drifting over him, astonished that a
religion capable of the beauty of her dance could treat death with such
barbarity. At last, to his infinite relief, the servants indicated they could
leave. They gathered up the pot of sacred fire and took his arm to lead him
away. It was then he had pulled away, wanting to be alone with her one last
time. Finally, no longer able to check his tears, he had turned and started
blindly up the steps, alone.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Now he stared numbly back, as though awakened from a
nightmare. Almost without thinking, he searched the pocket of his jerkin until
his fingers closed around a flask of brandy. He drew deeply on it twice before
turning to make his way on through the streets of Agra.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>                                             *</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You took an astonishing risk merely to honor the whims
of your Hindu dancer, Ambassador.&quot; Nadir Sharif had summoned Hawksworth to
his reception room at sunset. &quot;Few men here would have done it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I've lived through plagues twice before. In 1592 over
ten thousand in London died of the plague, and in 1603, in the summer after
King James's coronation, over thirty thousand died, one person out of every five.
If I were going to die, I would have by now.&quot; Hawksworth listened to his
own bravado and wondered if it sounded as hollow as it was. He remembered his
own haunting fear during the height of the last plague, when rowdy, swearing
Bearers, rogues some declared more ill-bred than hangmen, plied the city with
rented barrows, their cries of &quot;Cast out your dead&quot; ringing through
the deserted streets. They charged sixpence a corpse, and for their fee they
carted the bodies to open pits at the city's edge for unconsecrated, anonymous
burial, the cutpurse and the alderman piled side by side. As he remembered
London again, suddenly the Hindu rites seemed considerably less barbaric.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You're a brave man, nonetheless, or a foolish
one.&quot; Nadir Sharif gestured him toward a bolster. &quot;Tell me, have your
English physicians determined the cause of the infection?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;There are many theories. The Puritans say it's God's
vengeance; and astrologers point out that there was a conjunction of the
planets Jupiter and Saturn when the last plague struck. But our physicians seem
to have two main theories. Some hold it's caused by an excess of corrupt humors
in the body, whereas others claim it's spread by poisonous air, which has taken
up vapors contrary to nature.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Nadir Sharif sat pensive and silent for a moment, as though
pondering the explanations. Then he turned to Hawksworth.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What you seem to have told me is that your physicians
have absolutely no idea what causes the plague. So they have very ingeniously
invented names for the main points of their ignorance.&quot; He smiled.
&quot;Indian physicians have been known to do the same. Tell me then, what do
you think causes it?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I don't know either. It seems to worsen in the years
after crops have been bad, when there are hungry dogs and rats scavenging in
the streets. During the last plague all the dogs in London were killed or sent
out of the city, but it didn't seem to help.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And what about the rats?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;There've always been men in England who make a living
as rat-catchers, but with the dogs gone during the plague, the rats naturally
started to multiply.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Nadir smiled thoughtfully. &quot;You know, the Hindus have a
book, the Bhagavata Parana, that warns men to quit their house if they see a
sickly rat near it. Indians have long assumed vermin bring disease. Have you
considered the possibility that the source of the plague might be the rats,
rather than the dogs? Perhaps by removing the dogs, you eliminated the best
deterrent to the bearer of the plague, the rats?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;No one has thought of that.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, the European plague has finally reached India,
whatever its cause.&quot; Nadir Sharif looked away gloomily. &quot;Almost a
hundred people died in Agra this past week. Our physicians are still searching
for a cure. What remedies do you use in England? I think His Majesty would be
most interested to know.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I suppose the measures are more general than specific.
Englishmen try to ward it off by purging the pestilent air around them. They
burn rosemary and juniper and bay leaves in their homes. During the last plague
the price of rosemary went up from twelve pence an armful to six shillings a
handful. But the only people helped seemed to be herb wives and gardeners. One
physician claimed the plague could be avoided by wearing a bag of arsenic next
to the skin. There's also a belief that if you bury half a dozen peeled onions
near your home, they'll gather all the infection in the neighborhood. And some
people fumigate the contagious vapors from their rooms by dropping a red-hot
brick into a basin of vinegar.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Do these curious nostrums work?&quot; Nadir Sharif
tried to mask his skepticism.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I suppose it's possible. Who can say for sure? But the
plague always diminishes after a time, usually with the onset of winter.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Doesn't your king do anything?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;He usually leaves London if an infection starts to
spread. In 1603, the year of his coronation, he first went to Richmond, then to
Southampton, then to Wilton. He traveled all summer and only returned in the
autumn.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Is that all he did? Travel?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;There were Plague Orders in all the infected towns. And
any house where someone was infected had to have a red cross painted on the
door and a Plague Bill attached. No one inside could leave. Anyone caught
outside was whipped and set in the stocks.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And did these measures help?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Englishmen resent being told they can't leave home. So
people would tear the Plague Bills off their doors and go about their business.
Some towns hired warders at sixpence a day to watch the houses and make sure no
one left. But when so many are infected, it's impossible to watch everyone. So
there were also orders forbidding assemblies. King James banned the holding of
fairs within fifty miles of London. And all gatherings in London were
prohibited by a city order—playhouses, gaming houses, cockpits, bear-baiting,
bowling, football. Even ballad singers were told to stay off the streets.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;His Majesty may find that interesting.&quot; Nadir
Sharif turned and signaled for <i>sharbat </i>from the servants. &quot;Perhaps
he should issue laws forbidding assembly before he leaves Agra.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Is he leaving?&quot; Hawksworth felt his heart stop.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Day after tomorrow.&quot; Nadir Sharif watched as the
tray of <i>sharbat </i>cups arrived and immediately directed it toward
Hawksworth.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;I have to see him one last time before he
leaves. Before I leave.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I really think that's impossible now. He's canceled the
daily <i>durbar</i>. No one can see him. Even I have difficulty meeting with
him.&quot; Nadir Sharif accepted a cup from the tray and examined Hawksworth
sorrowfully as he sipped it. &quot;In any case, I fear a meeting would do you
little good, Ambassador. He's busy arranging the departure for all the court,
including the <i>zenana</i>. There are thousands of people to move, and on very
short notice. In fact, I've been trying to see Her Majesty for several days,
but she has received no one.&quot; He smiled evenly. &quot;Not even her own
brother.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Where's His Majesty planning to go?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Not so very far, actually. Ordinarily he probably would</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>travel
north, toward Kashmir. But since winter is approaching, he's decided to go
west, to Fatehpur Sekri. The area around the old palace has remained free of
the infection.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But I have to see him.&quot; Hawksworth hesitated.
&quot;Do you know what's happened to Shirin?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Nothing, so far as I hear. I believe she's still being
held in the fort.&quot; Nadir Sharif studied Hawksworth. &quot;But I would
advise you in the strongest possible terms to avoid meddling in the business of
that Persian adventuress and her departed Sufi heretic.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What I do is my affair.&quot; Hawksworth set down his
cup harder than necessary. &quot;I insist on seeing His Majesty. I want you to
arrange it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But a formal meeting is really quite impossible,
Ambassador. Haven't I made that clear?&quot; Nadir Sharif paused to collect his
poise. &quot;But perhaps if you appeared when his entourage is departing Agra,
you might be able to speak with him. I have to insist, however, that a meeting
now would be pointless and possibly even dangerous, considering His Majesty's
disposition at the moment.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'll see him before he leaves, somehow. I'll find a
way.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then I wish you Godspeed, Ambassador.&quot; Nadir
Sharif put down his <i>sharbat </i>glass. &quot;Incidentally, there's a large
caravan leaving for Surat day after tomorrow. Should I make arrangements for
you to join it?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm not going anywhere until I see the Moghul.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You're a headstrong man, Ambassador. Please believe I
wish you well. Notwithstanding His Majesty's current views, I've always
regarded you highly.&quot; He signaled for a tray of betel leaves and rose,
flashing one of his official smiles. &quot;Who knows? Perhaps your luck is due
for a change.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Queen Janahara read the dispatch twice, the lines of her
mouth growing tighter each time, before passing it back to Arangbar. He studied
it again, holding it with a trembling hand, seeming not to fully comprehend its
meaning, then extended it to Nadir Sharif. The courtyard off Arangbar's private
library was deadly silent, all servants and eunuchs banished. The tapestries
shading the inner compartment had been drawn back, permitting the hard light of
morning to illuminate the flowered murals on the library's red sandstone walls.
Arangbar sipped wine from a gilded cup and studied Nadir Sharifs face while the
prime minister read, as though hoping somehow to decipher the document's
significance from his expression.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;He has plainly refused. Majesty.&quot; Nadir Sharifs
voice was strangely calm. &quot;When did this arrive?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;This morning. It's his reply to the pigeon I sent to
Burhanpur the day after the wedding, ordering him to return the command in the
south to Ghulam Adl and march to the northwest, to relieve the fortress at
Qandahar.&quot; Arangbar's eyes were bloodshot and grim. &quot;At least we know
now where he is.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We know nothing.&quot; Janahara reached for the
document and scrutinized it. &quot;This dispatch was sent four days ago. He
could be as far north as Mandu by now, or well on his way to Agra.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I doubt very much he will march anywhere.&quot; Nadir
Sharif cut her off without seeming to do so. &quot;Until he receives a response
to the terms he has demanded.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Repeat them to me.&quot; Arangbar was having difficulty
focusing on the wine cup and he shifted his gaze into the courtyard.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;They are very explicit. Majesty.&quot; Nadir Sharif
rolled the document and replaced it in the bamboo sleeve. &quot;Jadar has
refused to march to defend Qandahar unless his horse rank is raised to thirty
thousand, and unless the <i>jagirs </i>in Dholpur, those that were granted to
Prince Allaudin, are returned. What will you do?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;There can be no bargaining with an Imperial
order,&quot; Queen Janahara interjected. &quot;How many times will you be
intimidated? Remember he refused to undertake this campaign—which, I should
add, he has apparently bungled—until his <i>suwar </i>rank was elevated, and
his elder brother Khusrav was sent out of Agra. When will his demands
end?&quot; Her voice rose. &quot;Even now we do not know what has happened. All
we know for sure is that two months ago he marched south from Burhanpur. And
four days ago he was there again. Was he driven back when he tried to recapture
Ahmadnagar from Malik Ambar? Does the Deccan still belong to the Abyssinian?
Prince Jadar has much to answer.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But the dispatch was sent from Burhanpur. At least he
hasn't abandoned the city entirely, as some of the rumors said,&quot; Nadir
Sharif continued evenly. &quot;And I don't believe he has abandoned the south,
either. He would not permit it to remain in rebel hands. Whatever else he is,
he's a soldier first.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;For all we know he is now isolated at the fortress in
Burhanpur.&quot; Janahara studied the empty courtyard. &quot;If he has not
already lost the city.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;So what do you propose be done?&quot; Arangbar's voice
was slurred as he sipped from his cup.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;There's only one choice remaining, if you ever hope to
control Jadar.&quot; She spoke directly to Arangbar. &quot;Order Inayat Latif
to mobilize the Imperial army and march south, now. We have to know what's
happening there. Inayat Latif is a far abler general than Jadar. He, at least,
can ensure the Deccan is secure. Then we can handle the matter of Jadar's
demands.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But that could also give the appearance the Imperial
army is marching against Jadar.&quot; Nadir Sharif shifted uncomfortably.
&quot;He will see it as an ultimatum. Do you really think he will respond to
threats? You must know him better than that.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I know him all too well.&quot; Janahara's voice was
hard.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Your Majesty&quot;—Nadir Sharif turned directly to the
queen—&quot;perhaps if he is given more time, he will come to better . . .
appreciate his position. I suggest the first thing we do is request a
clarification of the military situation throughout the Deccan. Then we can send
the Imperial army, as reinforcements, if it still seems advisable.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm growing weary of constantly trying to outguess
Jadar.&quot; Arangbar examined his cup and noted gloomily that it was dry.
&quot;First the plague, and now the preparations for the move. I'm exhausted.
When do we depart?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm told the last of the elephants will be ready within
one</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>pahar</span></i><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>, Majesty.&quot; Nadir Sharif studied
the queen casually, wondering how far she would push her influence with
Arangbar. &quot;I agree with you it would be wisest to wait.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;If you insist on doing nothing, at least the Imperial
army should be mobilized and made ready.&quot; Janahara's dulcet voice was
betrayed by the quick flash in her eyes. &quot;Then Jadar will understand we
are prepared to act quickly if he remains defiant.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;How many men and horse does Inayat Latif have under his
command now?&quot; Arangbar searched the darkened recesses behind them for a
servant to summon with more wine.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;There are over a hundred thousand men here. Majesty,
and probably fifty thousand cavalry. Over three times the force Jadar took with
him to the south.&quot; Nadir Sharif paused. &quot;They could always move out
within, say, two to three weeks.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I insist the forces here at least be mobilized, and
moved to Fatehpur with the court . . . lest the army itself become contaminated
by the plague.&quot; Janahara hesitated for a moment and then continued evenly.
&quot;I'm prepared to order it in your name today. It would protect the army
from infection; you would have them with you if you needed them; and it would
also put Jadar on notice.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then prepare the orders for my seal, if it pleases
you.&quot; Arangbar sighed and reached for his turban. &quot;You're usually
right.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You know I'm right.&quot; She smiled warmly. &quot;And,
regardless, no harm will be done.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then it's settled.&quot; Arangbar tried unsuccessfully
to rise, and Nadir Sharif stepped forward, assisting him to his feet. &quot;I
have to hold <i>durbar </i>one last time today, quickly before we leave. The
Persian Safavid ambassador notified the <i>wazir </i>he has gifts and a
petition that must be brought to me before the court leaves Agra.&quot; He
grinned. &quot;The Safavis are so worried I will form an alliance with the
northwestern Uzbeks that their Emperor Shah Abbas sends gifts every
month.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You've decided to hold <i>durbar </i>today, after
all?&quot; Nadir Sharifs eyes quickened. &quot;If so, there's a Portuguese
official from Surat who also wishes to present some gifts from the Viceroy and
speak with you on a matter he said was delicate.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What 'delicate' matter does His Excellency have?&quot;
Janahara stopped sharply on her way toward the corridor and turned back.
&quot;I've heard nothing about it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I suppose we'll all discover that in <i>durbar</i>,
Majesty.&quot; Nadir Sharif bowed and was gone.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Brian Hawksworth waited in the crowded square of the <i>Diwan-i-Am</i>,
holding a large package and hoping the rumored appearance of Arangbar was true.
For the past four days the Moghul had not held <i>durbar</i>, had remained in
complete isolation. But only an hour before, talk had circulated in the square
that Arangbar would hold a brief reception before departing, probably in a tent
pavilion that had been erected in the center of the square. As though to verify
the speculation, slaves had unrolled several thick carpets beneath the tent,
installed a dais, and were now positioning his throne onto the platform.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth stared about the square and felt his palms sweat.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Is this the last time I ever see the Moghul of India? And
Shirin never again? Is this how it ends?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He had spent the last several days in a private hell,
thinking of Shirin and waiting for the first fever, the first nodules that
would signal the plague. So far there had been no signs of the disease. And he
had heard that the consensus in the bazaar was the infection would subside
within the month. Clearly it would be nothing like London in 1603.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Palace rumors said that Shirin was still alive. All
executions had ceased after the appearance of the plague. And stories were that
the Moghul was rarely seen sober. Perhaps, Hawksworth told himself, Arangbar
has stayed so drunk he has forgotten her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He had finally conceived one last plan to try to save her.
Then he had packed his chest, settled his accounts, and dismissed his servants.
If nothing came of the meeting today . . . if there was a meeting . . . he
would have to leave in any case.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He moved closer to the royal pavilion, pushing his way
through the melee of shirtless servants. The elephants for the <i>zenana </i>had
been moved into the square and were now being readied. There were, by
Hawksworth's rough count, approximately a hundred elephants to carry Arangbar's
women. The <i>howdahs </i>for the main wives were fashioned from gold, with
gratings of gold wire around the sides to provide a view and an umbrella canopy
of silver cloth for shade. A special elephant was waiting for Queen Janahara
and Princess Layla, decorated with a canvas of gold brocade and bearing a
jewel-studded <i>howdah</i>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As Hawksworth watched, another elephant, shining with black
paint and the largest he had ever seen, lumbered regally into the square,
ridden by a mahout with a gold-braided turban. Its covering was even more
lavish than that of the queen's mount, and its <i>howdah </i>was emblazoned
with the Imperial standard of Arangbar, a long-tailed lion crouching menacingly
in front of a golden sun face. Beneath the verandas rows of saddled horses
waited for the lesser members of the court, each with a slave stationed
alongside bearing an umbrella of gold cloth, and in front of the horses were
rows of crimson-colored palanquins, their pearl-embroidered velvet gleaming in
the light, ready for high officials.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The roadway leading from the square of the <i>Diwan-i-Am </i>had
been lined with a guard of three hundred male war elephants, each with a cannon
turret on its back. Behind those, three hundred female elephants stood idling
in the sunshine, their backs covered with gold cloth marked with the Moghurs
insignia, waiting to be loaded with household goods from the <i>zenana</i>.
Just beyond the gate a host of watermen were poised with waterskins slung from
their backs, ready to run before the Moghul’s procession sprinkling the roadway
to banish dust. Near them a small party of men stood holding the harness of a
camel bearing a roll of white cloth, used to cover and banish from sight any
dead animals that might lie along the route of the Moghuls party.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The courtyard erupted with a sudden blare of trumpets and
kettledrums, and Hawksworth turned to see Arangbar being carried in on an open
palanquin, supported by uniformed eunuchs. A slave walked along one side,
holding a satin umbrella over his head for shade, while on the other, two
chubby eunuchs walked fanning him with sprays of peacock feathers attached to
long poles.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As the palanquin neared the tent, Hawksworth pushed through
the crowd to gain a better view. Arangbar was dressed for a ceremonial
occasion, wearing a velvet turban with a plume of white <i>heme </i>feathers
almost two feet in length. A walnut-sized ruby dangled from one side of the
turban, and on the other side was a massive diamond, paired with a heart-shaped
emerald. Around his turban was a sash wreathed with a chain of pearls. Rings
bearing flashing jewels decorated every finger, and his cloak was gold brocade,
decorated with jeweled armlets.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As he descended from the palanquin, at the entry of the
pavilion, the nobles near him yelled &quot;Padshah Salamat,&quot; Long Live the
Emperor, and performed the <i>teslim</i>. As he moved toward his throne two
more eunuchs were waiting. One stepped forward and presented an enormous pink
carp on a silver tray, while the other held out a dish of starchy white liquid.
Arangbar dipped his finger in the liquid, touched it to the fish, then rubbed
his own forehead—a Moghul ceremony presaging good omens for a march.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Next, another eunuch stepped forward, bowed, and presented
him with a sword. He stared at it for a moment as though confused, then shakily
ran his finger along the diamonds set in the scabbard and the braided gold
belt. As the eunuch urged it toward him, he nodded and allowed it to be buckled
at his waist. Another eunuch then presented him with a golden quiver containing
thin bamboo arrows and a gleaming lacquer bow.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As he mounted the dais, two eunuchs moved to his side, each
waving a gold-handled tail of white yak hair intended to drive away flies.
Another fanfare of trumpets and drums cut the air as the eunuchs helped him
onto the throne.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Only when Arangbar was seated did Hawksworth notice</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>that Nadir
Sharif and Zainul Beg were already waiting at the foot of the dais. He also
noted Queen Janahara was not present. And then he realized why. The servants
had neglected to erect her screen, the one she normally sat behind to dictate
his decisions. Since the appearance of Arangbar's solitary rule still had to be
maintained, she could not be seen publicly issuing orders, at least not yet.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth smiled to himself, wondering whose head would roll
for the oversight. Then, as he watched Nadir Sharif begin explaining petitions
to Arangbar, he thought he sensed a gleam of triumph in the prime minister's
eye. Could it be the failure to install a screen was deliberate?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The Persian Safavid ambassador approached with the obligatory
gift, this time an ornamental case containing a ruby on a gold chain, and then
handed up a paper. Arangbar listened to Nadir Sharif explain the document, then
appeared to ponder it a moment. Finally he waved his arms lightly and agreed to
something Hawksworth did not catch. The ambassador bowed his appreciation,
revolved with enormous dignity, and retreated into the sunshine.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Arangbar was already beginning to grow restless, clearly
anxious to dismiss everyone and begin loading the <i>zenana </i>women onto
their elephants. He turned and spoke to Nadir Sharif, who replied quickly and
motioned toward a Portuguese emissary in a starched doublet who stood waiting,
together with Father Sarmento. It was the first time Hawksworth had noticed
them, and he felt his gut knot in hatred as he shoved his own way forward
toward the pavilion.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Arangbar listened with a glazed expression, nodding
occasionally, as the Portuguese emissary delivered an elaborate speech,
translated by Sarmento, and began laying out the contents of a chest he
carried. With theatrical flair he drew out several large silver candlesticks, a
brace of gold- handled knives with jewel-embossed sheaths, a dozen wine cups of
Venetian crystal. Then he produced a leather packet with a red wax seal. He
spoke a few more words and passed it to Nadir Sharif.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The prime minister examined it, broke the seal to extract the
parchment, then gestured for Sarmento to come forward to translate. The Jesuit
suddenly looked very old and very uneasy as he adjusted his peaked black hat
and took the paper.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth shoved closer, and for the first time Arangbar
seemed to notice him. The Moghul’s eyes darkened and he started to say
something in Hawksworth's direction, but Sarmento had already begun the
translation into Turki.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;His Excellency, Miguel Vaijantes, sends this message of
his high regard and everlasting friendship for His Most High Majesty, the Great
Moghul of India. He bows before you and hopes you will honor him by accepting
these few small tokens of his admiration.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Sarmento shifted and cleared his throat. Arangbar's eyes had
fluttered partially closed and his head seemed to nod sleepily at the
conventional flattery.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;His Excellency asks Your Majesty's indulgence of a
grievous misdeed last week by a captain of one of our patrol vessels. He
assures Your Majesty that the captain will be stripped of all rank and returned
in chains to Goa within the month.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Arangbar's eyes had again opened and he shifted slightly on
the throne. &quot;What 'misdeed' is referred to?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Sarmento looked at the emissary, who quickly replied in
Portuguese. The Jesuit turned again to Arangbar.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Your Majesty will doubtless receive a dispatch from
Surat within a short time describing an unfortunate incident. His Excellency
wants you to understand in advance that it was a mistaken order, undertaken
entirely without his knowledge or approval.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Arangbar was fully awake now and staring down at the two
Portuguese.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What order? Did the Viceroy order something he now
wishes to disown? What was it?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It's the unfortunate matter of the <i>Fatima</i>, Your
Majesty.&quot; Sarmento turned helplessly toward the Portuguese emissary, as
though he too were searching for an explanation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What about the <i>Fatima</i>? She's my largest cargo
vessel. She's due in Surat in two days, with goods from Persia.&quot;
Arangbar's face was sober now. &quot;Her Highness, Maryam Zamani, had eighty <i>lakhs
</i>of rupees . . .&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The <i>Fatima</i> is safe, Your Majesty. She has only
been detained at sea, on a mistaken interpretation of His Excellency's
orders.&quot; Sarmento seemed to be blurting out the words. &quot;But he wishes
to assure you . . .&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;Impossible!&quot; Arangbar's voice was
suddenly a roar. &quot;He would not dare! He knows the cargo was under my seal.
I have a copy of the cartaz sent to Goa.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It was a grievous mistake, Majesty. His Excellency
sends his deepest apologies and offers to . . .&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It was done on <i>someone's </i>order! It had to be
his. How can it be a 'mistake'!&quot; Arangbar's face had gone purple.
&quot;Why was it ordered in the first place?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Sarmento stood speechless while the envoy spoke rapidly into
his ear. Then he looked back at Arangbar. &quot;Mistakes are always possible,
Majesty. His Excellency wishes to assure you the vessel and all cargo will be
released within two weeks.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I demand it be released immediately! And damages equal
the value of the cargo brought to me personally.&quot; Arangbar's face was
livid. &quot;Or he will never again have a <i>pice </i>of trade in an Indian
port.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Sarmento turned and translated quickly to the emissary. The
Portuguese's face dropped over his moustache and he hesitantly spoke something
to Sarmento.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We regret we have no power at this time to authorize a
payment for damages, Majesty. But we assure you His Excellency will . . .&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then 'His Excellency' will have no more trade in
India.&quot; Arangbar turned, his face overflowing with rage, and shouted to
the guards standing behind him. As they ran to his side he drew his sword and
waved it drunkenly at the emissary, whose face had gone white. &quot;Take him
away.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As the guards seized the terrified Portuguese by the arms,
sending his hat tumbling onto the carpet, he looked imploringly at Nadir
Sharif. But the prime minister's face was a mask. Then Arangbar turned on
Father Sarmento. &quot;If His Excellency has anything else to say to me, he
will say it himself, or he will send someone with the authority to answer me. I
do not receive his <i>peons</i>.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Sarmento flinched at the insulting Goan slang for dockhand.
&quot;Your Majesty, again I assure you . . .&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot; You will never again assure me of anything. I've
listened to your assurances for years, largely on matters about which you have
only belief, never proof. You assured me of the power of the Christian God, but
never once would you accept the challenge of the Islamic mullahs to cast a
Bible and the Quran into a fire together, to show once and for all which held
sacred truth. But their test is no longer needed. Your Christian lies are
over.&quot; Arangbar rose unsteadily from his throne, his brow harrowed by his
fury. &quot;I order your stipend terminated and your church in Agra closed. And
your mission in Lahore. There will never again be a Christian church in India.
Never.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Your Majesty, there are many Christians in India.&quot;
Sarmento's voice was pleading. &quot;They must have a priest, to minister the
Holy Sacrament.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then do it in your lodgings. You no longer have a
church.&quot; Arangbar settled back on the throne, his anger seeming to
overwhelm him. &quot;Never see me again unless you bring news the ship is
released, and my demands met. Never.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Sarmento watched in horror as Arangbar dismissed him with a
gesture of his arm. The old Jesuit turned and moved trembling into the crowd
that had pushed around the sides of the pavilion. As he passed by Hawksworth,
he suddenly stopped.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;This was all because of you.&quot; His voice quivered.
&quot;I learned of this only today from my foolish prodigal, Pinheiro. May God
have mercy on you, heretic. You and your accomplices have destroyed all His
work in India.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As Hawksworth tried to find an answer he heard a drunken
shout.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Inglish! What are you doing here? Come forward and
explain yourself.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He looked up to see Arangbar motioning at him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Are you deaf? Come forward.&quot; Arangbar glared
mischievously. &quot;Why are you still in Agra? We were told we sent you away,
almost a week ago. I think I may decide to have you and every other Christian
in India hanged.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;May it please Your Majesty, I came to request an
audience.&quot; Hawksworth moved quickly forward, past the confused guards,
carrying the package he had brought.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And what have you stolen of ours, Inglish? Have you
come now to tell us it was all a mistake, before I order your hand cut
off?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Englishmen are not Portugals, Your Majesty. We do not
take what is not our own. What have I ever taken that Your Majesty did not
freely give?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It's true what you say, Inglish. You are not a
Portuguese.&quot; Arangbar suddenly beamed as a thought flashed through his
eyes. &quot;Tell me, Inglish, will your king destroy their fleets for me
now?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Why would he do so, Your Majesty? You have denied him
the right to trade; you have refused to grant the <i>firman </i>he
requested.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Not if he will rout the Portuguese infidels from our
seas, Inglish. They are a pestilence, a plague, that sickens all it
touches.&quot; Arangbar waved in the direction of a eunuch, ordering wine for
himself. &quot;You deceived me once, Inglish, but you did not rob me. Perhaps
we will have you stay here a few days longer.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I have already made preparations to depart, Your
Majesty, on your orders.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You cannot travel without our permission, Inglish. We
still rule India, despite what the Portuguese Viceroy may think.&quot; Arangbar
paused and drank thirstily from the glass of wine. &quot;So why did you want an
audience, Inglish, if you were planning to leave?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth paused, thinking of the decision he had made,
wondering again if there was a chance.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I've come to make a trifling request of Your
Majesty.&quot; He moved forward and bowed, presenting his parcel, the
obligatory gift.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What's this have you brought us, Inglish?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;May it please Your Majesty, after settling my accounts
in Agra, I have no money remaining to purchase gifts worthy of Your Majesty. I
have only this remaining. I offer it to Your Majesty, in hopes you will
understand its unworthiness in your eyes is matched only by its unequaled value
to me. It is my treasure. I have had it by my side for over twenty years, at
sea and on land.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Arangbar accepted the parcel with curiosity and flipped aside
the velvet wrap. An English lute sparkled against the sunshine.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What is this, Inglish?&quot; Arangbar turned it in his
hand, examining the polished cedar staves that curved to form its melon-shaped
back.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;An instrument of England, Your Majesty, which we hold
in the same esteem you grant your Indian sitar.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;This is a curious toy, Inglish. It has so few
strings.&quot; He examined it a moment longer, then turned to Hawksworth.
&quot;Do you yourself play this instrument?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I do, Your Majesty.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then we will hear it.&quot; Arangbar passed the lute
back to Hawksworth, while the nobles around them buzzed in astonishment.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth cradled it against him. The feel of its body
flooded him with sadness as he realized he would never play it again. Memories
of London, Tunis, Gibraltar, a dozen cabins and lodgings, flooded over him. He
inhaled deeply and began a short suite by Dowland. It was the one he had played
for Shirin that afternoon so long ago in the observatory in Surat.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The clear notes flooded the canopied pavilion with their rich
full voice, then drifted outward into the square, settling silence in their
path. The suite was melancholy, a lament of lost love and beauty, and
Hawksworth found his own eyes misting as he played. When he reached the end,
the last crisp note died into a void that seemed to be his own heart. He held
the lute a moment longer, then turned to pass it back to Arangbar.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The Moghul’s eyes seemed to be misting as well.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>&quot;I have
never heard anything quite like it, Inglish. It has a sadness we never hear in
a raga. Why have you never played for us before?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Your Majesty has musicians of your own.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But no instrument like this, Inglish. Will you have
your king send us one?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But I have given you mine, Majesty.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Arangbar examined the lute once more, then looked at
Hawksworth and smiled. &quot;But if I keep this instrument now, Inglish, I will
most probably forget by tomorrow where I have put it.&quot; He winked at
Hawksworth and handed back the lute. &quot;Have your king send us one, Inglish,
and a teacher to instruct our musicians.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth could not believe what he was hearing. &quot;I
humbly thank Your Majesty. I . . .&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Now what was it you came to ask of us, Inglish?&quot;
Arangbar continued to study the lute as he sipped from his wine. &quot;Ask it
quickly.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Merely a trifling indulgence of Your Majesty.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then tell us what it is, Inglish.&quot; Arangbar turned
and searched the square with his eyes, as though monitoring the state of
preparations.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth cleared his throat and tried to still his pulse.
&quot;Your Majesty's release of the Persian woman Shirin, who is guilty of no
crime against Your Majesty.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Arangbar's smile faded as he turned back to Hawksworth.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We have not yet decided her fate, Inglish. She does not
concern you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;May it please Your Majesty, she concerns me very much.
I come to ask Your Majesty's permission to make her my wife, and to take her
back to England with me, if Your Majesty will release her. She will be gone
from India soon, and will trouble Your Majesty no further.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But we just told you you are not returning, Inglish.
Not until we permit it.&quot; He grinned. &quot;You must stay and play this
instrument for us more.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then I beg that her life be spared until the time I am
allowed to leave.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent2>Arangbar studied Hawksworth and a grudging smile
played on his lips. &quot;You are an excellent judge of women, Inglish. Perhaps
too much so. I suspected it the first time I saw you.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;She wishes no ill toward Your Majesty. There is no
purpose in taking her life.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;How do you know what she wishes for us, Inglish? I
think we know better than you.&quot; Arangbar paused to sip again from his wine
cup. &quot;But we will spare her for now, if your king will agree to send
warships to drive the infidel Portuguese from our shores. And if you will agree
to play more for me.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Will Your Majesty order her release?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I will move her to my <i>zenana</i> for now, Inglish.
Until matters are settled, I will order her brought with us to Fatehpur. That
is my part of the bargain. What will you do about yours?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I will inform my king of Your Majesty's wishes.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And he will comply, if he wants to trade in India.&quot;
Arangbar turned to Nadir Sharif. &quot;Order a horse for the Inglish. He will
ride with us today. And have the woman Shirin sent to the <i>zenana</i>.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Nadir Sharif bowed and edged next to Arangbar,
adopting a confidential tone.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;If I may be allowed, Your Majesty, you are aware the
woman Shirin would not be entirely welcome in the <i>zenana </i>by Her Majesty,
Queen Janahara.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;Her Majesty is not the Moghul of India.&quot;
Arangbar seemed suddenly exhilarated by the absence of the queen. &quot;I have
ordered it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;To hear is to obey.&quot; Nadir Sharif bowed low,
casting a worried glance toward Hawksworth. &quot;But perhaps it would be
equally pleasing to Your Majesty . . . and to Her Majesty as well . . . to
allow the woman to travel to Fatehpur under the cognizance of the English
ambassador.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Arangbar glanced toward the palace, and his exhilaration
seemed to dissolve as suddenly as it had come. &quot;Until Fatehpur, then.
After that we will decide where she will be kept until the Inglish satisfies
his part of the bargain.&quot; Arangbar turned to Hawksworth. &quot;Agreed,
Inglish?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I bow to Your Majesty's will.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;<i>Durbar</i> is concluded.&quot; Arangbar rose by
himself and moved to the edge of the tent pavilion. As the trumpets and drums
again sounded, the fanning eunuchs scurried to stay beside him. He stepped into
the sunshine, stared about the square for a moment, then turned to Nadir
Sharif.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Order everyone cleared and the women brought. I am
suddenly growing weary of Agra.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Nadir Sharif bowed again and spoke quickly to the captain of
the guard. As the order was circulated, he quietly moved next to Hawksworth.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;So it seems your luck changed after all, Ambassador.
For now. But I fear it may not last. As a friend I suggest you make the most of
it.&quot;</span></p>

<h2><a name=bookmark29><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX</span></a></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>       The
dark sky had begun to show pale in the east, heralding the first traces of day.
Hawksworth stood in the shadows of his tent, at the edge of the vast Imperial
camp, and pulled his frayed leather jerkin tighter against the cold. He watched
as the elephants filed past, bulky silhouettes against the dawn. They were
being led from the temporary stables on the hill behind him toward the valley
below, where cauldrons of water were being stoked for their morning bath.
Heating the water for the elephant baths had become routine during the reign of
Akman, who had noticed his elephants shivering from their baths on chilly
mornings and decreed their bath water warmed henceforth.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As he watched the line of giant animals winding their way
through the camp, waving their trunks in the morning air, he realized they were
not docile female <i>zenana </i>elephants, but male war elephants, first and
second rank.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>First-ranked war elephants, called &quot;full blood,&quot;
were selected from young males who had demonstrated the endurance and even
temper essential in battle; those granted Second Rank, called
&quot;tiger-seizing,&quot; were slightly smaller, but with the same temperament
and strength. Each elephant had five keepers and was placed under the training
of a special military superintendent—whose responsibility was to school the
animal in boldness amid artillery fire. The keepers were monitored monthly by
Imperial inspectors, who fined them a month's wages if their elephant had
noticeably lost weight. Should an elephant lose a tusk through its keepers'
inattention to an infection, they were fined one eighth the value of the
animal, and if an elephant died in their care, they received a penalty of three
months' wages and a year's suspension. But the position of elephant keeper was
a coveted place of great responsibility. A well-trained war elephant could be
valued at a hundred thousand rupees, a full <i>lakh</i>, and experienced
commanders had been known to declare one good elephant worth five hundred
horses in a battle.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth studied the elephants, admiring their disciplined
stride and easy footing, and wondered again why the army had stationed its
stables so near the Imperial camp. Did Arangbar somehow feel he needed
protection?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;They're magnificent, don't you think?&quot; Shirin
emerged from her tent to join him, absently running her hand across the back of
his jerkin. It had been six days since they had left Agra, and it seemed to
Hawksworth she had grown more beautiful each day, more loving each night. The
nightmare of the past weeks had already faded to a distant memory. She was
fully dressed now, with a transparent scarf pinned to her dark hair by a band
of pearls, thick gold bracelets, flowered trousers beneath a translucent skirt,
and dark <i>kohl </i>highlighting her eyes and eyebrows. He watched, enthralled
as she pulled a light cloak over her shoulders. &quot;Especially in the
morning. They say Akman used to train his royal elephants to dance to music,
and to shoot a bow.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;I don't think I'll ever get used to
elephants.&quot; Hawksworth admired her a moment longer in the dawn light, then
looked back at the immense forms lumbering past, trying to push aside the
uneasy feeling their presence gave him. &quot;You'd be very amused to hear what
people in London think they're like. Nobody there has ever seen an elephant, but
there are lots of fables about them. It's said elephants won't ford a clear
stream during the day, because they're afraid of their reflection, so they only
cross streams at night.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Shirin laughed out loud and reached to kiss him quickly on
the cheek. &quot;I never know whether to believe your stories of England.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I swear it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And the horse-drawn coaches you told me about. Describe
one again.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It has four wheels, instead of two like your carts
have, and it really is pulled by horses, usually two but sometimes four. It's
enclosed and inside there are seats and cushions . . . almost like a
palanquin.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Does that mean your king's <i>zenana </i>women all ride
in these strange coaches, instead of on elephants?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;In the first place, King James has no <i>zenana</i>. I
don't think he'd know what to do with that many women. And there are absolutely
no elephants in England. Not even one.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Can you possibly understand how hard it is for me to
imagine a place without elephants and <i>zenanas</i>?&quot; She looked at him
and smiled. &quot;And no camels either?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;No camels. But we have lots of stories about camels
too. Tell me, is it true that if you're poisoned, you can be put inside a newly
slain camel and it will draw out the poison?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Shirin laughed again and looked up the hill toward the
stables, where pack camels were being fed and massaged with sesame oil. The
bells on their chest ropes sounded lightly as their keepers began harnessing
them, in strings of five. Hawksworth turned to watch as the men began fitting
two of the camels to carry a <i>mihaffa</i>, a wooden turret suspended between
them by heavy wooden poles. All the camels were groaning pitifully and biting
at their keepers, their customary response to the prospect of work.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That sounds like some tale you'd hear in the bazaar.
Why should a dead camel draw out poison?&quot; She turned back to Hawksworth.
&quot;Sometimes you make the English sound awfully naive. Tell me what it's
really like there.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It is truly beautiful. The fairest land there is,
especially in the late spring and early summer, when it's green and cool.&quot;
Hawksworth watched the sun emerge from behind a distant hill, beginning to
blaze savagely against the parched winter landscape almost the moment it
appeared. Thoughts of England suddenly made him long for shade, and he took
Shirin's arm, leading her around the side of their rise and back into the
morning cool. Ahead of them lay yet another bleak valley, rocky and sere.
&quot;I sometimes wonder how you can survive here in summer. It was already
autumn when I made landfall and the heat was still unbearable.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Late spring is even worse than summer. At least in
summer there's rain. But we're accustomed to the heat. We say no <i>feringhi </i>ever
gets used to it. I don't think anyone from your England could ever really love
or understand India.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Don't give up hope yet. I'm starting to like it.&quot;
He took her chin in his hand and carefully studied her face with a scrutinizing
frown, his eyes playing critically from her eyes to her mouth to her vaguely
aquiline Persian nose. &quot;What part do I like best?&quot; He laughed and
kissed the tip of her nose. &quot;I think it's the diamond you wear in your
left nostril.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;All women wear those!&quot; She bit at him. &quot;So I
have to also. But I've never liked it. You'd better think of something
else.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He slipped his arm around her and held her next to him,
wondering if he should tell her of his bargain with Arangbar—that she had been
released only because he had offered to take her from India forever. For a
moment the temptation was powerful, but he resisted. Not yet. Don't give her a
chance to turn headstrong and refuse.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You know, I think you'd like England once you saw it.
Even with no elephants, and no slaves to fan away the flies. We're not as
primitive as you seem to imagine. We have music, and if you'd learn our
language, you might discover England has many fine poets.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Like the one you once recited for me?&quot; She turned
to face him. &quot;What was his name?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That was John Donne. I hear he's a cleric now, so I
doubt he's writing his randy poems and songs any more. But there</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>are others.
Like Sir Walter Raleigh, a staunch adventurer who writes passable verse, and
there's also Ben Jonson, who writes poems, and plays also. In fact, lots of
English plays are in verse.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What do you mean by plays?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;English plays. They're like nothing else in the
world.&quot; He stared wistfully into the parched valley spread out before
them. &quot;Sometimes I think they're what I miss most about London when I'm
away.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, what are they?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;They're stories that are acted out by players. In
playhouses.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She laughed. &quot;Then perhaps you should begin by
explaining a playhouse.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The best one is the Globe, which is just across the
Thames from London, in the Bankside edge of Southwark, near the bridge. It was
built by some merchants and by an actor from Stratford-up-on-Avon, who also
writes their plays. It's three stories high and circular, with high balconies.
And there's a covered stage at one side, where the players perform.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Do the women in these plays dance, like our <i>devadasis</i>?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Actually the players are all men. Sometimes they take
the roles of women, but I've never seen them dance all that much. There are
plays about famous English kings, and sometimes there are stories of thwarted
love, usually set in Italy. Plays are a new thing in England, and there's
nothing like them anywhere else.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Shirin settled against a boulder and watched the shadows cast
by the rising sun stretch out across the valley. She sat thoughtfully for a
moment and then she laughed. &quot;What would you say if I told you India had
dramas about kings and thwarted love over a thousand years ago? They were in
Sanskrit, and they were written by men named Bhavabhuti and Bhasa and Kalidasa,
whose lives are legends now. A pandit, that's the title Hindus give their
scholars, once told me about a play called The Clay Cart. It was about a poor
king who fell in love with a rich courtesan. But there are no plays here now,
unless you count the dance dramas they have in the south. Sanskrit is a dead
language, and Muslims don't really care for plays.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'll wager you'd like the plays in London. They're
exciting, and sometimes the poetry can be very moving.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What's it like to go to see one?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;First, on the day a play is performed they fly a big
white banner of silk from a staff atop the Globe, and you can see it all over
London. The admission is only a penny for old plays and two pence for new ones.
That's all you ever have to pay if you're willing to stand in the pit. If you
want to pay a little more, you can get a seat in the galleries around the side,
up out of the dust and chips, and for a little extra you can get a cushion for
the seat. Or for sixpence you can enter directly through the stage door and sit
in a stall at the side of the stage. Just before the play begins there's a
trumpet fanfare— like Arangbar has when he enters the <i>Diwan-i-Am</i>—and the
doorkeepers pass through the galleries to collect the money.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What do they do with it?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;They put it into a locked box,&quot; Hawksworth
grinned, &quot;which wags have taken to calling the box office, because they're
so officious about it. But the money's perfectly safe. Plays are in the
afternoon, while there's daylight.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But aren't they performed inside this building?&quot;
Shirin seemed to be only half listening.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The Globe has an open roof except over the stage. But
if it gets too dull on winter afternoons, they light the stage with torches of
burning pitch or tar.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Who exactly goes to these playhouses?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Everyone. Except maybe the Puritans. Anybody can afford
a penny. And the Globe is not that far from the Southwark bear gardens, so a
lot of people come after they've been to see bearbaiting. The pit is usually
full of rowdy tradesmen, who stand around the stage and turn the air blue with
tobacco smoke.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;So high-caste women and women from good families
wouldn't go.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Of course women go.&quot; Hawksworth tried unsuccessfully
to suppress a smile. &quot;There are gallants in London who'll tell you the
Globe is the perfect place to spot a comely wench, or even a woman of fashion
looking for some sport while her husband's drunk at a gaming house.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I don't believe such things happen.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well that's the way it is in England.&quot; Hawksworth
settled against the boulder. &quot;You have to understand women there don't let
themselves be locked up and hidden behind veils. So if a cavalier spies a
comely woman at the Globe, he'll find a way to praise her dress, or her figure,
and then he'll offer to sit next to her, you know, just to make sure some rude
fellow doesn't trod on the hem of her petticoats with muddy boots, and no chips
fall in her lap. Then after the play begins, he'll buy her a bag of roasted
chestnuts, or maybe some oranges from one of the orange-wenches walking through
the galleries. And if she carries on with him a bit, he'll offer to squire her
home.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I suppose you've done just that?&quot; She examined him
in dismay.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth shifted, avoiding her gaze. &quot;I've mainly
heard of it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, I don't enjoy hearing about it. What about the
honor of these women's families? They sound reprehensible, with less dignity
than <i>nautch </i>girls.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;Oh no, they're very different.&quot; He turned
with a wink and tweaked her ear. &quot;They don't dance.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That's even worse. At least most <i>nautch </i>girls
have some training.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You already think English women are wicked, and you've
never even met one. That's not fair. But I think you'd come to love England. If
we were in London now, right this minute, we could hire one of those coaches
you don't believe exist . . . a coach with two horses and a coachman cost
scarcely more than ten shillings a day, if prices haven't gone up . . . and
ride out to a country inn. Just outside London the country is as green as Nadir
Sharif’s palace garden, with fields and hedgerows that look like a great
patchwork coverlet sewed by some sotted alewife.&quot; Hawksworth's chest
tightened with homesickness. &quot;If you want to look like an Englishwoman,
you could powder your breasts with white lead, and rouge your nipples, and
maybe paste some beauty stars on your cheeks. I'll dine you on goose and veal
and capon and nappy English ale. And English mutton dripping with more fat than
any lamb you'll taste in Agra.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Shirin studied him silently for a moment. &quot;You
love to talk of England, don't you? But I'd rather you talked about India. I
want you to stay. Why would you ever want to leave?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm trying to tell you you'd love England if you gave
yourself a chance. I'll have the <i>firman </i>soon, and when I return the East
India Company will . . .&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Arangbar will never sign a <i>firman </i>for the
English king to trade. Don't you realize Queen Janahara will never allow
it?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Right now I'm less worried about the queen than about
Jadar. I think he wants to stop the <i>firman </i>too, why I don't know, but
he's succeeded so far. He almost stopped it permanently with his false rumor
about the fleet. He did it deliberately to raise Arangbar's hopes and then
disappoint him, with the blame falling on me. Who knows what he'll think to do
next?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You're so wrong about him. That had nothing to do with
you. Don't you understand why he had to do that? You never once asked me.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth stared at her. &quot;Tell me why.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;To divert the Portuguese fleet. It's so obvious. He
somehow discovered Queen Janahara had paid the Portuguese Viceroy to ship
cannons to Malik Ambar. If the Marathas had gotten cannon, they could have
defended Ahmadnagar forever. So he tricked the Portuguese into searching for the
English fleet that wasn't there. The Portuguese are a lot more worried about
their trade monopoly than about what happens to Prince Jadar. He knew they
would be.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;I know you support him, but for my money he's
still a certified bastard.&quot; Hawksworth studied her for a moment, wondering
whether to believe her words. If it were actually true it would all make sense,
would fill out a bizarre tapestry of palace deception. But in the end his ruse
had done Jadar no good. &quot;And for all his scheming, he was still defeated
in the south. I hear the rumors too.&quot; Hawksworth rose and took Shirin's
arm. She started to reply, then stopped herself.  They began to walk slowly
back toward his tent. &quot;So he deceived everyone to no purpose.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As they rounded the curve of the slope and emerged into the
sunshine, Hawksworth noted that some of the war elephants had already been led
back to their stables and were being harnessed. He looked across the valley
toward the tents of the Imperial army and thought he sensed a growing urgency
in the air, as though men and horse were being quietly mobilized to move out.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But don't you realize? The prince is not
retreating.&quot; Shirin finally seized his arm and stopped him. &quot;No one
here yet realizes that Malik Ambar has . . .&quot; Her voice trailed off as she
looked ahead. A group of Rajput officers was loitering, aimlessly, near the
entrance to her tent. &quot;I wish I could tell you now what's happening.&quot;
Her voice grew quieter. &quot;Just be ready to ride.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth stared at her, uncomprehending. &quot;Ride where?&quot;
He reached to touch her hand, but she glanced at the Rajputs and quickly pulled
it away. &quot;I don't want to ride anywhere. I want to tell you more about
England. Don't you think you'd like to see it someday?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I don't know. Perhaps.&quot; She shifted her gaze away
from the Rajputs. For an instant Hawksworth thought he saw her make a quick
movement with her hands urging them to leave. Or had she? They casually moved
on down the hill, their rhino-hide shields swinging loosely from their shoulder
straps. &quot;After . . . after things are settled.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;After what? After Arangbar signs the <i>firman</i>?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I can't seem to make you understand.&quot; She turned
to face him squarely. &quot;About Prince Jadar. Even if you got a <i>firman </i>it
would soon be worthless.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I understand this much. If he's thinking to challenge
Arangbar, and the queen, then he's God's own fool. Haven't you seen the army
traveling with us? It's three times the size of Jadar's.&quot; He turned and
continued to walk. &quot;His Imperial Majesty may be a sot, but he's in no peril
from young Prince Jadar.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As they approached the entrance to his tent, she paused for a
moment to look at him, her eyes a mixture of longing and apprehension.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I can't stay now. Not today.&quot; She kissed him
quickly and before he could speak she was moving rapidly down the hill, in the
direction the Rajputs had gone.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Queen Janahara studied Allaudin thoughtfully as he strode
toward her tent. His floral turban was set rakishly to one side in the latest
style, and his purple gauze cloak was too effeminate for anyone but a eunuch or
a dandy. She caught a flash from the jewel-handled katar at his waist, too
ornamental ever to be used, and suddenly realized that she had never seen him
actually hold a knife, or a sword. She had never seen him respond to any
crisis. And Princess Layla had hinted he was not quite the husband she had
envisioned, whatever that might imply.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Suddenly it all mattered. It had only been a week since
Jadar's demands had been refused, and already he had taken the initiative. Now,
she sighed, she would have to protect her <i>nashudani</i>, her
&quot;good-for-nothing&quot; son-in-law. He could never protect himself, not
from Jadar.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Your Majesty.&quot; Allaudin salaamed formally as he
dipped below the tapestried portiere of her tent, never forgetting that his new
mother-in-law was also the queen. &quot;The princess sends her wishes for your
health this morning.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Sit down.&quot; Janahara continued to examine him with
her brooding dark eyes. &quot;Where is Nadir Sharif?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The eunuchs said he would be a few moments late.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;He always tries to irritate me.&quot; Her voice trailed
off as she watched Allaudin ensconce himself with a wide flourish against a
velvet bolster. &quot;Tell me, are you content with your bride?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;She is very pleasing to me, Majesty.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Are you satisfying your obligations as a husband?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Majesty?&quot; Allaudin looked up at her as though not
comprehending the question.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;Your duties are not merely to her. Or to me.
They're also to India. Jadar has a male heir now. Such things matter in Agra,
or weren't you aware?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Allaudin giggled. &quot;I visit her tent every night,
Majesty.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But for what purpose? After you're drunk and you've
spent yourself with a <i>nautch </i>dancer. Don't deny it. I know it's true. Do
you forget she has servants? There are no secrets in this camp. I think you'll
sooner sire an heir on a slave girl than on my daughter. I will not have
it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Majesty.&quot; Allaudin twisted uncomfortably and
glanced up with relief to see Nadir Sharif pushing aside the portiere of the
tent. As he entered, Janahara motioned toward the servants and eunuchs waiting
in attendance and in moments they had disappeared through the curtained
doorways at the rear.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You're late.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;My sincerest apologies, Majesty. There are endless
matters to attend. You know His Majesty still holds morning <i>darshan </i>from
his tent, and has two <i>durbar </i>audiences a day. The difficulties . .
.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Your 'difficulties' are only beginning.&quot; She was
extracting a dispatch from a gilded bamboo tube. &quot;Read this.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Nadir Sharif took the document and moved into the light at
the entrance. He had always despised the red chintz tents of the Imperial
family, whose doorways were forever sealed with Persian hangings that kept in
all the smoke and lamp soot. As he studied the dispatch he moved even closer to
the light, astonishment growing in his eyes. He read it through twice before
turning back to Janahara.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Has His Majesty seen this yet?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Of course not. But he will have to eventually.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Who is it from?&quot; Allaudin stared up from the
bolster, his voice uneasy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Your brother.&quot; Janahara studied him with eyes
verging on contempt. &quot;Jadar has declared he is no longer under the
authority of the Moghul.&quot; She paused to make sure the news had reached
Allaudin. &quot;Do you understand what that means? Jadar has rebelled. He's
probably marching on Agra right now with his army.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;That's impossible! As long as His Majesty
lives . . .&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Jadar has declared His Majesty is no longer fit to
reign. He has offered to assume the 'burden' himself. It's a preposterous
affront to legitimate rule.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then he must be brought to Agra for trial.&quot; Allaudin's
voice swelled with determination.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Obviously.&quot; Nadir Sharif moved toward the door of
the tent and stared into the sunshine for a long moment. Then he turned to
Janahara. &quot;We have no choice now but to send the Imperial army. Your
intuition about Jadar last week was all too correct.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And now you agree? After a week has been lost.&quot;
Janahara had followed him with her eyes. &quot;Now you concede that the army
must move.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;There's nothing else to be done.&quot; Nadir Sharif
seemed to study the parched landscape of the valley below. &quot;Although
containing Jadar may well be more difficult than we first assumed.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Why should it be difficult?&quot; Allaudin watched
Nadir Sharif in bewilderment. &quot;His forces were very small to begin with.
And after his defeat by Malik Ambar, how many men and cavalry can he have
left?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Perhaps you should read the dispatch.&quot; Nadir
Sharif tossed the scrolled paper into Allaudin's lap. &quot;Jadar never engaged
Malik Ambar. Instead he forged an alliance. It would appear his 'retreat' north
to Burhanpur was merely a ruse. He never met the Maratha armies in the first
place, so he did not lose a single infantryman. Instead he intimidated Malik
Ambar and struck a truce with him. There's no knowing how large his army is
now, or even where he is. This dispatch came from Mandu, so he's already well
on his way north. I think he'll probably lay siege to Agra within two weeks if
he's not stopped.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Merciful Allah.&quot; Allaudin's voice was suddenly
tremulous. &quot;What do we do?&quot; Then he looked imploringly at Janahara.
&quot;I'll lead the army myself if you want.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Janahara seemed not to hear him as she rose and walked toward
the door of the tent. Nadir Sharif stepped aside as she shoved back the
tapestry and stared out into the valley.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;This morning I ordered Inayat Latif to mobilize and
march.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Without telling His Majesty!&quot; Nadir Sharif stared
at her incredulously.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I ordered it in his name. I suspected something like
this might happen, so I had him sign and stamp the order four days ago.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Was His Majesty entirely sob . . .&quot; Nadir Sharif
hesitated. &quot;Was he in full understanding of what he was authorizing?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That hardly matters now. But you must place the seal
you keep on the order also before it's forwarded to the <i>wazir </i>to be
officially recorded.&quot; She did not shift her gaze from the sunlit valley.
&quot;It's on the table behind you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Nadir Sharif turned and stared down at the gold-inlaid stand.
The order was there, a single folded piece of paper inside a gilded leather
cover. The string which would secure it had not yet been tied.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You were wise to have taken this precaution,
Majesty.&quot; Nadir Sharif glanced back at Janahara, his voice flowing with
admiration. &quot;There's no predicting His Majesty's mind these days. Only
yesterday I discovered he had completely forgotten . . .&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Have you stamped it?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;My seal is not here, Majesty.&quot; He paused.
&quot;And I was wondering . . . would it be wise to review our strategy briefly
with His Majesty, lest he become confused later and forget he authorized the
order? Perhaps even countermand it?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Your seal will be sufficient. It's in the pocket of
your cloak where you always carry it, the pocket on the left.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Your Majesty's memory is astonishing sometimes.&quot;
Nadir Sharif quickly extracted the metal case, flipped off the cover, and with
a flourish imprinted the black Seal of the Realm on the top of the order,
beneath Arangbar's signature and the impression of his royal signet ring.
&quot;When will the army be able to move?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Tomorrow. Most of the elephants are moving out this
morning.&quot; Janahara turned back and glanced at the paper with satisfaction.
&quot;And tomorrow we will all return to Agra. The plague is subsiding, and I
think His Majesty should be in the fort.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I agree entirely. Has it been ordered?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I will order it later today. Jadar cannot move his army
that rapidly.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I will begin preparations to go with the army.&quot;
Allaudin rose and adjusted the jeweled katar at his belt.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You will be returning to the Red Fort, with His Majesty
and with me.&quot; Janahara did not look at him as she spoke.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But 1 want to face Jadar. I insist.&quot; He tightened
his gauze cloak. &quot;I will demand an audience with His Majesty if you
refuse.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Janahara studied him silently for a moment. &quot;I have an
even better idea. Since Jadar has refused to lead the army to defend the
fortress at Qandahar, how would you like to be appointed in his place?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Allaudin's eyes brightened. &quot;What rank would I
have?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I think we can persuade His Majesty to raise your
personal rank to twelve thousand <i>zat </i>and your horse rank to eight
thousand <i>suwar</i>, twice what you have now.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent2>&quot;Then I will go.&quot; Allaudin tightened his
cloak, beaming. &quot;I'll drive the Safavid king's Persian troops back into
the desert.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You are as sensible as you are brave. I will speak to
His Majesty tonight.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent2>Allaudin grinned a parting salaam, squared his
shoulders, and pushed his way through the portiere and into the sunshine. Nadir
Sharif watched without a word until he had disappeared into his own tent.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Was that entirely wise, Majesty?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What else do you propose we do? It will keep him in
Agra. I'll see to that. You don't really think I'd allow him to leave? Anyway,
it's time his rank was elevated. Now all he needs is a son.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm sure he'll have one in time, Majesty. The Hindu
astrologers all say Princess Layla's horoscope is favorable.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The Hindu astrologers may have to help him do a
husband's work if they want to save their reputation.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Give him time, Majesty.&quot; Nadir Sharif smiled.
&quot;And he'll have more heirs than the Holy Prophet.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;All the Prophet's children were daughters.&quot; She
took the paper, inserted it into the gold case, and began tying the string.
&quot;There are times you do not entirely amuse me.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm always half distracted by worrying.&quot; Nadir
Sharif followed her with his eyes. &quot;Even now.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What in particular worries you at the moment?&quot;
Janahara paused as she was slipping the case into her sleeve.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm thinking just now about the Imperial army. The
loyalty of some of the men.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What do you mean? Inayat Latif is entirely beholden to
His Majesty. He would gladly give his life for the Moghul. I've heard it from
his own lips, and I know it's true.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I've never questioned your commander's loyalty. But now
you . . . His Majesty will be ordering the men to march against Jadar. Are you
aware that fully a third of the army is under Rajput field commanders, officers
from the northwest. Some of the rajas there still bear ill feelings toward His
Majesty, because of Inayat Latifs campaign there ten years ago. These Rajputs
sometimes have long memories. And who knows what Jadar could be promising them?
Remember his treachery with Malik Ambar.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What are you suggesting? That the Rajput commanders
will not fight for His Majesty, the legitimate Moghul? That's absurd. No one
respects authority more than the Rajput rajas.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm not suggesting it at all. But I do believe the
Rajputs here should be monitored closely nonetheless. Any discontent should be
addressed before it grows . . . unwieldy. Perhaps their commanders should be
placed under a separate authority, someone who could reason with them in His
Majesty's name if there are signs of unrest. Inayat Latif is an able general,
but he's no diplomat.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Janahara studied him closely. &quot;Do you believe there
would be unrest?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Your Majesty is perhaps not always fully informed as to
the activities of some of the more militant Rajput loyalists. I have ordered
them watched at all times.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What are you suggesting then? That the Rajputs should
be placed under a separate top command? Some raja whose loyalty is
unquestionable?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm suggesting precisely that. If there were extensive
defections, it would be demoralizing for the rest of the army, at the very
least.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Who do you propose?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;There are any number of Rajput commanders I would
trust. To a point. But it's always difficult to know where their final
loyalties lie.&quot; Nadir Sharif paused, lost in thought. &quot;Perhaps an
alternate solution might be to allow someone of unquestioned loyalty to monitor
the Rajput field commanders, someone experienced in handling Rajput concerns,
though not necessarily a general. Then the command could remain unified, with
orders passing through this other individual, who would ensure
compliance.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Again, is there someone you would recommend?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;There are several men near His Majesty who could serve.
It is, of course, essential their loyalty to you be beyond question. In a way
it's a pity Prince Allaudin is not . . . older. Blood is always best.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That leaves only you, or Father, who is far too
old.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;My responsibilities here would really make it
impossible for me.&quot; Nadir Sharif turned and walked again to the door of
the tent, pulling back the portiere. &quot;Certainly I could not leave His
Majesty for an extended campaign.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But if the campaign were short?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Perhaps for a few weeks.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Janahara studied him silently, her thoughts churning. At
times even Nadir Sharif’s loyalty seemed problematical. But now there was a
perfect way to test it in advance . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I will advise Inayat Latif you are now in charge of the
Rajput commanders.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Your Majesty.&quot; Nadir Sharif bowed lightly.
&quot;I'm honored by your confidence.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm sure it's well placed.&quot; She did not smile.
&quot;But before I make the arrangements, there's one other assignment for you.
Totally confidential.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Anything within my power.&quot; Nadir Sharif bowed
elegantly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Tonight I want you to order the Imperial guards
stationed in your compound to execute the Englishman and the woman Shirin. On
your sole authority.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Of course.&quot; Nadir Sharifs smile did not flicker.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth finally returned to his compound near midnight,
carrying his empty flask of brandy. He had wandered the length of the chaotic
tent city searching for Shirin. Over the past five hours he had combed the wide
streets of the bazaar, searched through the half-empty elephant stables, and
circled the high chintz border of the Imperial enclosure. The periphery of the
camp swarmed with infantrymen and their wives gathering supplies for the march,
and already there had been numerous fights in the bazaar, where prices had
soared after the announcement the army would march.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As he neared his tent, he looked up at the stars, brilliant
even through the lingering evening smoke from the cooking fires, and mused
about Jadar. The rebel prince would soon be facing Inayat Latif, just recalled
to Agra two months earlier after a brutally successful campaign in Bengal
extending the Imperial frontier against local Hindu chieftains. Inayat Latif
was a fifty-five-year-old veteran commander who revered the Moghul and would do
anything in his power to protect him. Although he had made no secret of his
dislike of the &quot;Persian junta,&quot; he shared their common alarm at the
threat of Jadar's rebellion. It was Arangbar he would be fighting to defend,
not the queen.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The Imperial army is invincible now, Hawksworth told himself,
its cavalry outnumbers Jadar's easily three to one, and its officers are at
full strength. There are at least a hundred and fifty thousand men ready to
march. How many can Jadar have? Fifty thousand? Perhaps less. Jadar can never
meet them. The most he can possibly do is skirmish and retreat.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Perhaps, he thought ruefully, it was all just as well. A
decisive defeat for Jadar would <i>Resolve</i> the paralysis at court, and the
indecision in Shirin's mind. She would realize finally that Jadar had attempted
to move too fast.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The mission might still be saved. With the Portuguese
resistance neutralized—there were even rumors that Arangbar had ordered Father
Sarmento back to Goa—there would be no voices in Agra to poison Arangbar's mind
daily against the <i>firman </i>for King James. After all, he asked himself,
who else could Arangbar turn to? England alone has the naval strength to
challenge Portugal, even if it might require years to break their monopoly
completely. He would bargain for a <i>firman </i>in exchange for a vague
promise of King James's help against the Portuguese. It was a bargain England
surely could keep. Eventually.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He slipped through the doorway of his tent and groped for the
lamp, an open bronze dish of oil with a wick protruding through the spout. It
rested where he had left it, on a stand near his sea chest, and he sparked a
flint against the wick. Suddenly the striped cotton walls of the tent glowed
around him. He removed the sword at his belt and slipped it onto the carpet.
Then he removed his leather jerkin and dropped against a bolster, still
puzzling about Shirin.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Her status during the past few days had been ambiguous. As a
divorced Muslim woman, she was free to move about as she chose. But everyone
knew she was on very uncertain terms with the Moghul. After they had arrived
outside the western wall of the old city of Fatehpur, Arangbar had been too
preoccupied to remember his threat to move her into the <i>zenana</i>. She had
remained free, able to move inconspicuously about the camp, mingling with the
other Muslim women. And each night, after the final watch was announced,
Hawksworth had been able to slip unnoticed to her tent. Once, late one night,
he had suggested they try to return to the old palace of Akman, inside the
walls of Fatehpur, but they both finally decided the risk would be too great.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He had hoped the days, and nights, at the camp would bring
them closer together. And in a way they had, although Shirin still seemed to
retreat at times into a special realm of mourning she had devised for herself.
She could never stop remembering Samad and his brutal death.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Something, he told himself, had to change. He had begun to
wonder if he should gamble and tell her of the terms the Moghul had demanded
for her release. Would she then understand she had no choice but to return to
England with him?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He rose and rummaged through his sea chest, finding another
bottle of brandy, almost his last, and to fight his despondency he poured
himself a cup. The liquor burned its way down, like a warm soothing salve, and
he turned to begin assembling his few belongings for packing in the morning. He
had reprimed and loaded his remaining pistol, and now he laid it on the table
beside his chest. Then he drew his sword from its scabbard to check its edge
and the polish on the metal. Holding it to the lamp, he spotted a few random
flecks of rust, and he found a cloth and burnished them away.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>His few clothes were already piled haphazardly in the chest,
now virtually empty save for his lute. He found his leather purse at the bottom
and counted his remaining money. Five hundred rupees. He counted them twice,
beginning to wonder if he might eventually have to walk all the way back to
Surat.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He searched the floor for any stray items, and came across
Vasant Rao's katar caught between the folds of the carpet. It seemed years now
since the Rajput aide of Jadar had slipped it into his hand in the square of
the Diwan-i-Am, and he had almost forgotten he had it. With a smile of
recollection he gingerly slipped it from its brocade sheath and held it in his
hand, puzzling how such a curiously constructed weapon could be so lethal. The
grip was diagonal to the blade, so that it could only be used to thrust, like a
pike head growing out of your fist. Rajputs were said to kill tigers with only
a katar and a leather shield, but he wasn't sure he believed the stories. He
grasped it and made a few trial thrusts, its ten- inch blade shining in the
lamplight like a mirror, then tossed it atop his sea chest. It would make a
nice memento of the trip; every fighting man in India seemed to carry one. Who
in London would ever believe such a weapon unless they saw it?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Out of the corner of his eye he caught a flutter in the
portiere of his tent, and he looked up to see Shirin standing silently in the
doorway.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What . . . ?&quot; He looked up to greet her, unsure
whether to betray his relief by taking her immediately in his arms, or to scold
and tease her a bit first.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She silenced him with a wave of her hand.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Are you ready?&quot; Her voice was barely above a
whisper.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;Ready for what? Where in Christ's name have
you been? I've been . . .&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Again she silenced him as she moved inside.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Are you ready to ride?&quot; She glanced in dismay at
the belongings he had scattered about the tent. &quot;We have to leave now,
before dawn.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Have you gone mad?&quot; He stared at her. &quot;We're
returning to Agra day after tomorrow. The Moghul has . . .&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We have to leave now, tonight.&quot; She examined him
in the lamplight, consternation growing in her eyes. &quot;The prince . .
.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Jadar is finished.&quot; He cut her off. &quot;Don't be
a sentimental fool. He brought this on himself. You can't help him. Nobody can
now.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>They stood, eyes locked together, for a moment that seemed as
long as eternity. Hawksworth did not move from his place on the carpet.
Gradually her eyes clouded with sorrow, and he thought he saw her begin to
turn.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He was on his feet, seizing her arm, pulling her toward him.
&quot;I'm not letting you die for Jadar. If he's meant to win, he'll do it
without either of . . .&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He sensed a movement in the portiere behind her, and looked
up to see the glint of a sword thrust exactly where she had been standing. She caught
his bewildered look and revolved in time to see the sword slash through the
fringed cloth. An Imperial guard, wearing light chain mail and a red turban,
moved through the doorway, weapon in hand.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You son of a whore!&quot; Hawksworth reached back for
the naked sword lying on the carpet behind him and grabbed his leather jerkin.
Holding the leather as a shield, he lunged at the attacker.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As Hawksworth's sword thrust reached him, the guard caught
the blade with his own and instinctively parried it aside, throwing Hawksworth
against a tent pole.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As he tried to regain his footing, he heard Shirin cry out
and turned to see a heavy sword cut through the side of the tent behind them,
creating a second opening. A hand ripped away the striped chintz and another
Imperial guard entered, weapon in hand.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Jesus! Shirin, get back!&quot; Hawksworth shouted in
English and shoved her across his sea chest, sending her tumbling away from the
second attacker. As she fell, he saw her grab the pocket pistol lying on the
table and turn to face the guard approaching her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth felt a blade rip through the jerkin in his hand
and tangle in the leather. He shoved the jerkin and sword aside and cut upward
with his own blade, miraculously imbedding it in the exposed neck of the
turbaned guard. The man yelled out and dropped his weapon, which slid
harmlessly onto the carpet. Then he stumbled and fell forward, holding his
neck. Still incredulous, Hawksworth looked up to see two more Imperial guards
standing in the doorway behind him, both with drawn swords. As he moved to keep
them at bay with his own weapon, he turned and saw the guard who had entered
through the side of the tent advancing menacingly toward Shirin. Just as the
guard raised his weapon, Hawksworth heard a sharp report, followed by a moan,
and watched the man crumple and fall directly in front of her smoking pistol.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As he fell, two more guards appeared at the opening behind
him and began pushing their way through.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Shirin, the lamp!&quot; Again he shouted in English
before realizing she could not understand. Without waiting, he grabbed the open
oil lamp and flung it against the uniforms of the guards, bathing them in
burning oil. Their turbans and hair ignited and they pulled back against the
side of the tent, slapping at the flames.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>        He
turned back to the doorway in time to see the other two</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>guards
coming toward him. As he attempted to parry them away, he found his feet
tangled in the leather jerkin on the carpet and he stumbled backward, losing
his balance long enough for one of the attackers to bring his sword around with
a heavy sweep and knock his own weapon spinning into the dark recesses of the
tent.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As he grabbed a tent pole for balance he suddenly noticed the
dark outline of two more men approaching behind the guards at the door. In the
shadows he could tell they were shirtless, wearing only dirty loincloths and
the gray turbans of servants. They carried no weapons and had been attracted by
the uproar.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Looking quickly around the tent, he noticed the burning
outline of his oil-soaked powder horn lying on the carpet near his feet. He
kicked it toward the approaching guard and as it struck his leg, the cap jarred
free, sending hissing powder flaming through the tent. The man stumbled
backward in surprise and lowered his sword. Just as he did, Hawksworth saw one
of the servants standing at the doorway slip a naked katar from his loincloth
and seize the guard by the neck. He pulled the attacker around and with a flash
of steel gutted him silently with a savage upward thrust. The other Imperial
guard at the doorway turned just in time to watch the katar drawn by the second
servant enter his own throat.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth stared in astonishment, realizing he had never
before seen the two servants. Even now their faces were largely obscured by the
loose ends of their turbans.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He revolved to see the other two guards turning back toward
the opening that had been cut through the side of the tent, still slapping at
the burning oil on their uniforms. As they reached the opening, they seemed to hesitate
momentarily, then stumbled backward. As they sprawled across the carpet in
front of him, their throats cut, he saw two more grimy servants standing in the
opening, holding bloody katars.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The burning oil blazed across the fringe of a carpet and suddenly
the interior of the tent was crisscrossed with fire.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>The four
alien servants, all still holding katars, seemed to ignore the flames as they
advanced on Shirin and Hawksworth without a word.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He watched them for a moment in horror, then reached and groped
blindly across the top of his sea chest. It was bare. Then he remembered
Shirin's fall and he felt along the carpet behind the chest, next to where she
stood.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Just as the first man reached the edge of the chest,
Hawksworth's hand closed around the handle of his katar.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Jesus, what do they want? Did they kill the Imperial guards
so they could have the pleasure of murdering us themselves?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Bracing himself against the side of the chest, he swung the
blade upward. He still could not see the attacker's face, masked behind the end
of his turban.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The man stepped deftly to the side and caught Hawksworth's
wrist in a grip of iron, laughing out loud.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Never try to kill a Rajput with his own katar, Captain
Hawksworth. He knows its temperament too well.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Vasant Rao flipped back the ragged end of his turban.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What the bloody hell. . . !&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We've been waiting for you by Shirin's tent. It would
appear your welcome here has run out.&quot; He glanced mockingly at Shirin.
&quot;So much for your famous Muslim hospitality.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You know very well who's responsible.&quot; Her eyes
snapped back at him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I can probably guess.&quot; Vasant Rao released
Hawksworth's wrist and stared about the burning tent. &quot;Are you ready to
ride?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What the hell are you doing here?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;This is hardly the spot for long explanations. The fact
is I'm here tonight to lead some of our friends back to the camp of His
Highness, the prince. And you, if you cared to join us.&quot; Vasant Rao
signaled the men around him to move out through the doorway. The smoke was
already growing dense. &quot;I'm afraid your fire has made our departure that
much more difficult. It wasn't a particularly good idea on your part. Now we
have to ride quickly.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What about all this?&quot; Hawksworth looked about the
burning tent. &quot;I have to . . .&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Just roll what you need in a carpet. If you're going
with us, you'll have to leave now. Before the entire Imperial army comes to see
us off.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But who'd want to kill us?&quot; Hawksworth still could
not move as he stared through the smoke.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Whoever it was, they'll probably succeed if we wait
here talking much longer.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth turned on Shirin.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You knew!&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I couldn't tell you before. It would have been too
dangerous.&quot; She quickly grabbed a carpet from the floor, stamping out the
burning fringe, then flipped open Hawksworth's chest. She grabbed his lute, a
handful of clothes, his boots, his books, and his depleted purse. As he watched
in a daze, she rolled them in the carpet and shoved it into his hands. He
looked around the burning tent one last time and caught the glint of his sword
lying behind a tent pole. He grabbed it, scooped up his pistol and jerkin, and
took Shirin by the arm as they pushed through the smoke toward the entrance,
stepping over the bodies of the guards as they emerged into the night air.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Ahead, beside Shirin's tent, waited saddled horses and a
group of turbaned riders. As they ran toward the horses, Hawksworth recognized
several Rajputs from Arangbar's private guard among the horsemen.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We were ready to ride.&quot; Vasant Rao seized the rein
of one of the horses and vaulted into the saddle. &quot;You were out walking or
we could have left sooner. Shirin demanded we wait. It was well we did. Lord
Krishna still seems to be watching over you, Captain.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Which way are we headed?&quot; Hawksworth helped Shirin
into a saddle, watching as she uncertainly grabbed the horn for balance, then,
still clasping the bundle, pulled himself onto a pawing Arabian mare.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>       
Hawksworth heard the exultant cheer of the Rajputs riding behind him and
snapped awake. It was midmorning of the third day and he had been dozing
fitfully in the saddle since dawn, fatigue deep in his bones. Through the trees
ahead the camp of Prince Jadar lay spread before them, blanketing half the
valley.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I told you we'd make the camp in three days'
ride.&quot; Vasant Rao smiled wearily at Hawksworth and spurred his lathered
mount forward. &quot;Every man with us is eager to be with the prince.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>They had covered, it seemed to Hawksworth, well over a
hundred miles since departing the environs of Fatehpur. Between five and six
hundred Rajputs rode behind them, all heavily armed with an array of swords,
pikes, clubs, saddle-axes. Each man's body armor, a woven network of steel and
the quilted garment worn beneath it, was secured behind his saddle, ready to be
donned for combat. Hanging at the side of each rider was a round leather shield
and a large quiver containing his horn bow and arrows. None carried muskets.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth glanced back at Shirin, who rode a few paces behind,
and they shared a tired smile. She had ridden the distance like a Rajput, but
now her eyes were glazed with weariness. He had suddenly realized, the morning
after they all galloped out of the camp at Fatehpur, that he had never before
seen a woman in India ride. Where had she learned? He had pondered the question
for an hour, riding behind her to watch her easy posture in the saddle, and
then he had pulled alongside and asked her point-blank. She said nothing,
merely smiled and tossed the loose strands of hair back from her face. He
understood her well enough to know this meant she had never ridden before . . .
and didn't wish Vasant Rao to know.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;This is the moment I've waited for so long.&quot; She
reined her mount alongside Hawksworth's, reached out and touched his hand.
&quot;You must help the prince now too.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm not so sure I'm eager to die for Prince
Jadar.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You can always go back to Agra. And wait to be murdered
by Janahara's guards. The prince has saved your life, and mine, once already.
What makes you think he'll bother with you again?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;To tell the truth, he also saved my life several months
ago, the night we made landfall at Surat and were ambushed on the Tapti River
by the Portugals.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I know.&quot; She spurred her horse ahead. &quot;I
received the pigeon from Prince Jadar ordering it. I passed the message to the
Shahbandar, Mirza Nuruddin, who sent his personal Rajputs to protect you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth urged his horse back alongside. &quot;So I was
right. You were one of Jadar's agents in Surat. What did Nadir Sharif once call
them . . . <i>swanih-nigars</i>?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I gathered information for the prince.&quot; She smiled
in consent. &quot;I kept his accounts and coded his ciphers at the old
observatory. Then you came along and started combing through it. You made my
work that much more difficult. I never knew when you'd decide to go out there.
Or what you'd find.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Why didn't you just tell me? What did I care?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Too much was at risk. The prince once said never to
trust a <i>topiwallah</i>.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Hawksworth laughed. &quot;But surely Mukarrab Khan
knew what you were doing?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I think he probably guessed. But what could he do? He
was only the governor, not Allah. He finally forbade me to go into the palace
grounds alone. When I refused to obey, he thought of sending you to the
observatory, just to annoy me.&quot; She smoothed the mane of her horse.
&quot;So I think he knew I was doing something there. But he was too entangled
by his own intrigues for Janahara to really care.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Mukarrab Khan worked for the queen? How?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Two ways. Naturally he gathered intelligence for her,
mainly about the Portuguese. But he also collected her Portuguese revenues at
the ports of Surat and Cambay.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Her revenues? I thought all duties went to the Moghul’s
Imperial treasury.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Shirin stifled a smile. &quot;That's what Arangbar thinks
too. And at Surat it's mostly true. She collects very little. Mirza Nuruddin
despises her and always finds devious ways to muddle her accounts, probably
keeping some of her money for himself. But the Shahbandar at the port of
Cambay, where Mukarrab Khan used to go every two weeks, would accept bribes
from the Portuguese to undervalue their goods, and then split the money with
Mukarrab Khan and Janahara.&quot; She paused to watch a bright-winged bird dart
past. &quot;Arangbar could never understand why his revenue from Cambay was so
low. I heard he's thinking about closing the port.&quot; She laughed. &quot;If
only he knew it's going mostly to Janahara.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth rode silently for a moment, thinking. &quot;You
know, Nadir Sharif once proposed the same arrangement for English goods, if I
would trade with him personally through the port of Cambay. I ignored him. I
suspected he planned to find some way to confiscate the goods later on,
claiming nonpayment of duty.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;No, on that I think Nadir Sharif would have been very
fair. He always honors his agreements, with friend or foe.&quot; She looked
ahead, her weary eyes brightening as they approached the first jumble of tents
and roaming livestock that formed the edge of the camp. Servants in soiled <i>dhotis
</i>were leading camels bearing huge baskets of fodder along the makeshift
streets between the tents. &quot;But their swindle will be finished when Prince
Jadar becomes Moghul. He despises the Portuguese traders and their Christian
priests.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The perimeter of the compound reserved for Jadar and his <i>zenana
</i>was clearly visible now, towering above the center of the camp. It was
bordered by a ten-foot-high wall of billowing red chintz, decorated with a
white hem at the top and held up with gilded poles spaced no more than two feet
apart. Spreading out around it were clusters of smaller tents—red and white
striped cloth for noblemen, and onesided lean-to shelters ranging from brocade
to ragged blankets for their troops.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The prince asked that we all ride directly to the <i>gulal
bar</i>, his personal compound,&quot; Vasant Rao shouted back over his shoulder
at Hawksworth. &quot;I think he'll particularly want to see you, Captain.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Cheers erupted as they entered the camp. Tents emptied and
infantrymen lined the sides of the wide avenue leading to Jadar's compound,
beating their swords against their leather shields. As Hawksworth studied the
forest of flying standards spreading out on either side, he suddenly realized
that each <i>mansabdar </i>nobleman was flying his own insignia above his
cluster of tents.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Ahead, rising upward from the center of Jadar's compound, was
a pole some fifty feet high with a huge vessel of burning oil secured on its
tip. Hawksworth examined the flame with astonishment, then drew his horse
alongside Vasant Rao's.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Why's there a light in the middle of the camp? It can
be seen for miles?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That's called the <i>akas-diya</i>, Captain, the Light
of Heaven. It's the Great Camp Light and it's used by everyone to keep their
bearings at night. How else could a man find his tent? There are probably fifty
thousand men here, with their women and servants. In the evenings, after all
the cow-dung fires are lighted for cooking, it's so smoky here you can't see
your own tent till you're practically in it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;This camp's a town almost the size of London. How do
the people live?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The camp bazaar travels with us, Captain. But you're
right. It is a city; merely one that moves.&quot; He gestured around them.
&quot;The prince of course has his own personal supplies, but everyone else
must shift for himself. See those small tents on the street over there, between
those two high poles bearing standards. That's one of the bazaars for the <i>banyas</i>,
Hindu merchants who follow the army and sell grain, oil, <i>ghee</i>, rice, <i>dal</i>,
everything you'd find in any town. They feed the men. The horses are fed by
sending servants out to gather fodder. They cut grass and bring it back on
camels, or baggage ponies, or even on their own head. On a long campaign many
of the men bring their women, to cook and carry water. The women have to bring
water from any wells or streams nearby.&quot; He laughed. &quot;Incidentally, I
should warn you the prices these <i>banyas </i>ask are as inflated as the
market will bear.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;For once I can't fault the merchants. They may
well be out of buyers soon.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Vasant Rao snorted and whipped his horse ahead. They were
approaching the entry to Jadar's compound, a wide silk awning with the prince's
banners flying from atop its posts. On either side stood rows of ornate red
tents with yellow fringe along the eaves. As Hawksworth rode by, he noticed a
high open tent on the left holding caged hunting leopards. Next to it stood a
massive canopy, surrounded by guards, sheltering light artillery. He squinted
against the sun to look inside and caught a glimpse of several dozen small-bore
cannon mounted on carriages. He also noticed swivel guns fitted with a harness
on their base, obviously intended to be mounted atop elephants or camels. In
the center were several stacks of long-barreled Indian muskets wrapped in
cloth. The last tent on the left, adjacent to the gate, sheltered several
gilded palanquins and a row of immaculate bullock carts for Jadar's <i>zenana </i>women.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>On the opposite side of the avenue was a row of stables for
elephants, camels, and horses. Turbaned grooms were busy brushing the animals
and fitting harness. Next to the stables were quarters for the animals'
superintendents.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Does all this belong to Jadar?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;These are for the prince, his women, and guards. Each
nobleman also has his own stables and light artillery. The top command is split
three ways: with separate field commanders for the Rajputs, for the Muslims,
for the men of Moghul descent.&quot; Vasant Rao smiled reflectively. &quot;It's
always wisest not to mix. For one thing, each needs its own bazaar; no Rajput
would eat food handled by an untouchable Muslim.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Their horses drew into the shade of the awning above the
entrance to the gulal bar. Vasant Rao and the other Rajputs reined in their
mounts and began to dismount.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;This is the <i>naqqara-khana</i>, Captain Hawksworth,
the entry to His Highness' private compound.&quot; Vasant Rao waved toward the
red awning. &quot;Come. You'll be welcomed warmly by the prince, I promise you.
I know he'd hoped you'd join him.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth swung down from his dark mare and stroked her one
last time, wiping away the lather around the saddle. Then he turned to help
Shirin alight. She leaned over and dropped into his arms, the sweat of
exhaustion mingled with her perfume.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Grooms from Jadar's stables were already waiting. As they
took the horses, the leader of the Rajput riders shouted staccato orders to
them in Urdu, the lingua franca of the camp, then turned and dismissed his men,
who immediately swaggered into the gathering crowd to embrace old
acquaintances.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;His Highness is expecting you.&quot; Vasant Rao smiled
and bowed lightly to the Rajput commander, who was tan and beardless save for a
small moustache, with a white skirt, a small turban of braided gold cloth, and
a velvet-sheathed katar in a red waist sash. The Rajput nodded, then adjusted
his turban and retrieved a tightly wrapped brocade bundle from behind his
saddle. As he led the way through the <i>naqqara-khana</i>, Vasant Rao turned
and motioned for Hawksworth and Shirin to follow.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Jadar's guards directed them along a pathway of carpets
leading through the outer barbican. Ahead was another gate, decorated with
striped chintz and sealed with a hanging tapestry. As they approached it, the
guards swept the tapestry aside and ushered them through.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The second compound was floored entirely with carpets and in
its center stood an open, satin canopy held aloft by four gilded poles. The
canopy shaded a rich Persian carpet and a throne fashioned from velvet
bolsters. Several men with shoulder-high kettledrums and long brass trumpets
were waiting nearby.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As Hawksworth watched, two eunuchs emerged through a curtain
at the far gate and lifted it high. While a fanfare of drums and trumpets
filled the air, Prince Jadar strolled jauntily through the entryway, alone.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He was dressed formally, with an elaborate silk cloak in
pastel blue and a jeweled turban that reminded Hawksworth of the one worn by the
Moghul himself. The brocade sash at his waist held a heavy katar with a ruby on
each side of the handle. His beard was close-trimmed, accenting his dark eyes.
Nothing about him suggested the appearance of a man facing impending defeat.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Nimaste, Mahdu, my old friend.&quot; Jadar walked
directly to the Rajput commander, grasped the man's turban and pressed it to
his own breast. &quot;How long since we sat together and ate your Udaipur <i>lapsi
</i>from the same dish?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The New Year's festival of <i>diwali </i>two years
past, Highness. In my brother's palace. And I wore the gold cloak you gave me
in honor of the treaty between your armies and his, five years before.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And tonight we will dine together again.&quot; He
smiled. &quot;If my cooks can find enough cane-juice <i>gur </i>in all the
bazaars to sweeten your <i>lapsi</i>.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Seeing you again, Highness, sweetens my tongue
already.&quot; He bowed and produced the brocade bundle. &quot;My brother, the <i>maharana</i>,
sends this unworthy token, together with his prayers for your victory.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>A eunuch stepped forward and brought it to Jadar. When the
prince opened the wrapping, a scabbard holding a jewel-handled sword glistened
in the mid morning light.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;He does me honor. A Rajput blade knows its friends and
its foes.&quot; Jadar smiled as he brushed the sword handle. Next he drew out
the blade and tested its edge with his finger. The Rajput watched as Jadar
sheathed the sword, then lifted the ruby-studded katar from his own belt.
&quot;To honor him, I grant his brother my own katar. May its blade soon be
crimson with the blood of his foes.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The Rajput bowed as he received the knife. Jadar admired his
new sword a moment longer, then continued. &quot;How many of our friends rode
west with you?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Half a thousand, Highness. More would have joined us
now, but I thought it unwise. Your Highness will understand why. But those who
did come I picked carefully. Twenty officers of superior class, and the rest
first and second class.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The eunuchs watched your banners enter the camp. I've
already heard some of the names.&quot; The prince's voice rose. &quot;I think
you've gutted the Rajput field command in the Imperial army.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Not entirely, Highness.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Ah, but I know you did.&quot; Jadar smiled and leaned
forward, dropping his voice again and switching from Turki to Rajasthani.
&quot;The tent poles here can repeat my words.&quot; He drew himself erect
again and signaled for a tray of pan leaves from the eunuchs. &quot;A tent has
been prepared for you. Tonight we will dine again from the same dish and you
can tell me how many white-necked cranes you bagged on Pichola Lake last winter.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The Rajput clasped his hands together and bowed lightly
before taking a pan leaf. &quot;Tonight, Highness.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As Mahdu marched regally back through the entryway, Jadar
turned and studied Shirin thoughtfully for a moment. Then he motioned her
forward and smiled toward Vasant Rao. &quot;And who else did you bring? Yet
another old friend?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Shirin salaamed lightly. &quot;I thank Your Highness for
still remembering me.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I remember you very well. But the last I'd heard,
Janahara had ordered you imprisoned. I'm astonished to see you still
alive.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I was released by Arangbar, Highness, after Samad was
executed.&quot; She tried unsuccessfully to diguise the fatigue in her voice.
&quot;I still do not know why.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Perhaps it was his weakness for beauty.&quot; Jadar
smiled. &quot;But just now I think you need rest. Mumtaz has asked me to invite
you to stay with her in the <i>zenana</i>.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Shirin stays with me.&quot; Hawksworth heard his own
voice, abruptly rising above his exhaustion.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Jadar turned and studied him for a moment, then laughed out
loud. &quot;Suddenly I understand many, many things. Mumtaz was right after
all. Why is it women always seem to see these things so clearly?&quot; His gaze
swept Hawksworth's tattered jerkin. &quot;Well? How are you, Captain
Hawksworth? Still alive, I see, just as I foretold. And still the fashionable
English ambassador.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;There is no other. Unfortunately, however, my mission
was not a complete success.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;First, India must have a just rule. Then trade can be
conducted with an even hand.&quot; Jadar leaned back on his bolster. &quot;Tell
me, Captain, have you seen enough of Agra and court intrigue to rethink the
matter we once discussed?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I've probably seen all of Agra I'll ever see.&quot;
Hawksworth fixed Jadar squarely. &quot;But then I'll have much company.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Jadar sobered and regarded Hawksworth a moment in silence.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I see time still has not mellowed you. Or taught you
very much. Do you understand anything at all of land tactics, Sea Captain
Hawksworth?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I've never claimed to. But I can count infantry.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Jadar laughed again. &quot;You still amuse me, Captain. I'll
never know why. It saddens me there'll be so few occasions for us to pass the
time together during the next few days. But at least let me show you around my
compound. You'll see the next Moghul of India does not campaign entirely like a
destitute Arab.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Why don't we start with your fortifications?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Jadar roared as he lifted nimbly from his bolster throne and
walked into the sunshine. Then he paused and turned to Shirin. &quot;Join us if
you wish. And by the way, where've you decided to stay?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Shirin looked at Hawksworth for a moment, and their eyes
locked. Then he saw a smile flicker across her face. &quot;I'll stay with the
English ambassador, Highness.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;As you wish.&quot; Jadar's tone was wistful. &quot;I no
longer try to reason with the mind of a woman. But just let me caution you. If
you stay among the Muslims here, their women will spit on you unless you put on
a veil. They've never heard of Persia.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then we'll stay with the Rajputs.&quot; Shirin tossed
her head and followed along as Jadar led them through a side exit in the interior
chintz wall and into the outer perimeter of the compound. The kettledrums
thundered Jadar's exit.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;This side is for food, Captain.&quot; Jadar gestured
toward a</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>row of
ornate tents that lined the inside of the chintz walls. &quot;The first is for
fruit and melons. No man can campaign without them, particularly if he has a
hungry <i>zenana</i>. The tent over there is for making <i>sharbat</i>, and
that one is for keeping betel leaves to make <i>pan</i>.&quot; Jadar smiled.
&quot;Try denying a woman her betel and you'll have nothing but squabbles.&quot;
He led them on, pointing, as he walked. &quot;The large tent there is the
kitchen, the one beyond it the bakery, and the one past that for grinding
spices.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth found himself astonished. Who could lead an army
amid such extravagance? The tents were all red satin, with gilded poles around
the outside, giving them the appearance of luxurious pavilions. Some, like the
one for fruits and melons, were raised on a platform above the ground, while
others were two-story, with an interior stair. As he watched the servants
scurry from tent to tent bearing silver trays, he found it difficult to
remember a war was looming.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You'll soon discover traveling with women is always
burdensome, Captain. For example, on the other side of the <i>gulal bar </i>I've
had to erect a special tent just for their perfumes, another for their tailors,
another to hold their wardrobes. Then there's a tent for mattresses, one for
basins, and one for lamps and oil. These women rule my life. The things I
really need—workshops, guardhouses, my arsenal— I've had to situate back behind
the <i>zenana</i>, near where the servingwomen stay.&quot; Jadar paused, his
eyes gleaming mischievously. &quot;Well, what do you think?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I think an army camp should have fewer women and more
men.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Jadar laughed and looked pointedly at Shirin. &quot;But what
is life without women, Captain?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Wives don't travel with an army in Europe.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then Europe could learn something from India.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;About fighting or about women?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Before you're through you may learn a few thing about
both.&quot; Jadar turned and started back down the row of tents. &quot;War here
is very different from wars on the seas, Captain. You should see my men fight
before you judge them. But my question now is whether you know how to fight
well enough to be of any help. Tell me, can you handle a bow?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Armies don't use bows in England any more. I've
certainly never used one. I think the last time bows were issued for battle was
back around the time of the Spanish Armada, about thirty years ago. Some of the
local forces in Devonshire equipped eight hundred men with longbows.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Jadar paused uncertainly. &quot;What do you mean by
'longbow'?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It's a bow about five feet in length. The best ones are
made of yew, but they're also made from ash and elm.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You mean your bows are made entirely from wood?&quot;
Jadar's voice betrayed his skepticism. &quot;What weight did they pull?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I don't know exactly, but they were powerful enough.
You can draw a longbow all the way back to your ear. During the time of King
Harry it was forbidden to practice with a longbow using a range less than a
full furlong. The English longbow drove the crossbow right out of Europe. I've
heard it said a longbow can pierce a four-inch-thick oak door.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But you don't use them now?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We prefer muskets.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He seemed to ponder the answer as he led them back into his
carpeted reception area. He took his place beneath the canopy, then turned to
Hawksworth.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We use muskets too. But frankly they're often more
trouble than they're worth. They're cumbersome and inaccurate, and while you're
reloading and priming your matchlock a Rajput archer will put half a dozen
arrows through you. Infantry here normally is one-third matchlock men and
two-thirds archers. If you're going to be any help to us, Captain, you'll need
to learn to use a bow.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Jadar stopped and turned to look at Shirin. Her eyes were
fluttering with fatigue. &quot;But I forget my manners. You must have some rest
while we teach the <i>feringhi </i>how to fight. Perhaps the best thing would
be to clear a tent for you at the rear of the <i>gulal bar</i>, near the
workshops. And the English captain can stay there too,&quot; Jadar laughed.
&quot;So I can watch him practice his bow.&quot; He glanced back at Hawksworth
and his eyes froze on the pearl earring. &quot;I see you're a <i>khan</i> now,
as well as an ambassador. Congratulations. If Arangbar can make you a <i>khan</i>,
I can surely make you an archer.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Jadar motioned to the eunuchs, who came forward and escorted
Shirin through the rear doorway of the compound. Hawksworth was watching her
leave, praying for sleep himself, when Jadar's voice brought him back.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Let me begin by explaining our Indian bow to you,
Captain. I think it's probably quite different from the English bow you
described.&quot; Jadar turned to Vasant Rao and motioned toward his quiver, a
flat leather case hanging from a strap over one shoulder. It was covered with
gold embossing and held both his bow and his arrows. &quot;You know we have a
proverb: the sword is better than the katar, the spear is better than the
sword; the arrow better than the spear. I've heard Muslims claim the bow and
arrow were first given to Adam by the archangel Gabriel.&quot; Jadar paused
while Vasant Rao took out his bow and passed it over. &quot;Now, the first
thing you need to learn is how to string this. It's more difficult than you
might suppose, since a bow is reflexed, curved back around the opposite way
when unstrung. It's stressed against the strung position to give it more weight
on the pull.&quot; Jadar examined the bow for a moment. &quot;In fact, you can
tell how much use a bow has had by the way it's bent when unstrung. The
original curve in this bow is almost gone, which means it's had a lot of use.
Here hold it for a moment.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth grasped the bow in his hand. It was some four feet
long, shaped in a wide curve with the ends bent back. The grip was velvet, with
a gold-embossed design on the inner side.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You say your English bows are made of wood, but I find
that difficult to believe. This one is a composite, a mango-wood core with
strips of buffalo horn glued over the outside. And the outer curve is lined
with catgut to give it even more force. That's why this bow had to be sealed on
the outside with leather. We use leather or lacquer to protect the glue from
the dampness of the monsoon. The string, by the way, is a silk skein with a
crisscross binding at the center.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;How do you string it?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Jadar grinned as he took back the bow. &quot;It's not easy.
If you have to string a bow while riding, you hook one end between the stirrup
and the instep of your foot and brace it backward against your knee. But
usually we bend it over our back.&quot; He took the string in his hand and
slipped the bow around his waist. Then he flipped it against his back and
pulled its free end over his left shoulder, inverting the curve and hooking the
string in a single motion. It was done in an instant.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;There. But I've made it look easier than it is. You
should practice. And it would also be well if you could learn to string a bow
and shoot from horseback.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Horseback!&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;All horsemen use a bow.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;How can you possibly hit anything from horseback?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Practice. A good Rajput archer can shoot as well from
horseback as standing. The Uzbeks shoot better.&quot; As Jadar spoke he was
extracting a heavy ring from inside his cloak. One side of the ring was a green
emerald, flat and square and half an inch wide.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;This is a <i>zihgir</i>, a bow ring, to protect your
thumb when you draw. It also increases your range.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He pushed the emerald ring over his thumb, notched an arrow
into the string, and drew it back effortlessly, holding the thin bamboo arrow
in position with a touch of his forefinger. The whole sequence had taken less
than a second. Hawksworth found himself staring in admiration.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;By the way,&quot; Jadar turned to Vasant Rao,
&quot;show him how you shoot under a shield.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The Rajput turned to one of Jadar's guards, whose shield was
hanging loosely from a shoulder strap. He took the shield and slipped it onto
his wrist. It was circular, a quarter inch thick and about two feet in
diameter, and curved like a wide bowl. The front was figured with a silver
ensign and in the center were four steel nailheads, which secured the handgrips
on the back.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That shield's one of the best. It's made with cured
rhino</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>hide and
toughened with lacquer. You hold it by those two straps attached inside, there
in the center.&quot; Jadar pointed as Vasant Rao held out the back of the
shield. &quot;Notice the straps are large and loose. So when you want to shoot,
you can slip your hand through and slide the shield up your wrist, like he's
doing now. Then your hand extends out beyond the rim and you can hold the grip
of the bow. But remember you'll have no protection when shooting, so you'll
learn to shoot fast or you won't live long in a battle. Here, try the
shield.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth took the shield and gripped the leather thongs on
the back. &quot;It's light. How much protection does it give?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;A buffalo-hide shield is really only effective against
arrows, but a rhino-hide shield like this one will usually deflect musket fire.
We'll find a rhino shield for you somewhere.&quot; Jadar rose to leave.
&quot;Incidentally, after seeing how you handle that bow, I think I'd better
assign you to the guards stationed back with the <i>zenana</i>. That should
keep you well out of the battle. I don't want my first English ambassador dead
just yet.&quot; He fingered his long pearl necklace and studied Hawksworth.
&quot;You may be interested to know my reports say the Imperial army will reach
us in two days. Tomorrow I plan to poison all the tanks and water wells within
twenty <i>kos </i>east of here, forcing them to attack immediately. I hope
you'll be ready.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>He turned and was gone.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth awoke at noon the following day to discover work
had begun on fortification of the camp. He left Shirin sleeping and walked to
the eastern perimeter, where the heavy cannon were being drawn into position.
As he paused to study one of the cannon, he found himself comparing it with the
European design. It looked to be a six-inch bore, with a molded iron barrel
strengthened by brass hoops shrunk around the outside. It was bolted onto its
own carriage, a flat base supported by four solid wooden wheels, and pulled by
a team of ten white bullocks yoked in pairs. Cotton ropes almost two inches in
diameter were tied</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>around the
breech, looped beneath the axles and then through a heavy iron ring on the
front of the mount, extending forward to hooks on the yokes of the bullocks.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>While their drivers whipped the animals forward, a crowd of
moustachioed infantry in red and green tunics clustered around the gun
carriages pushing. A drummer in an orange cloak sat astraddle the breech of the
cannon beating cadence for the other men on two large drums strapped along each
side of the barrel. A large bull elephant trailed behind, heavy padding on his
forehead, and whenever the gun carriage bogged, the elephant would be moved
forward to shove the breech with his head.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As the cannon were rolled into position, some fifteen feet
apart, they were being linked to each other with heavy ropes of twisted bull
hide the size and strength of metal chain, to prevent cavalry from riding
through and cutting down the gunners. After the hide ropes were camouflaged
with brush, a leather screen was placed behind the breech of each gun to
protect the gunners when it fired.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth counted approximately three hundred cannon along
the camp perimeter. Firepots were being stationed behind each gun, together
with linstocks and leather barrels of powder. A few bags of dirt had been piled
between some of the cannon to provide protection for matchlock men. Around the
cannon, men were assembling piles of four-sided iron claws, and beyond, diggers
with picks and wicker baskets had begun a halfhearted effort to start
construction of a trench. He studied the preparations uneasily for a moment,
sensing something was wrong, and then he froze.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>There was no shot. Only stacks of iron claws.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He whirled and made his way back to the munitions depot, rows
of yellow-fringed tents. The shot was there waiting, in gauge ranging from two
inch to ten inch, but none had been moved.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He moved on to other tents and discovered several hundred
more cannon. Some were the same gauge as those being deployed, others much
larger. All had been fitted with harness, ready to be moved, but now they stood
in long rows, waiting. As he moved onto another row of tents, pushing through
the swarm of men and bullocks, he discovered a vast cache of smaller cannon,
thousands, also mounted on wooden carriages but small enough to be moved by a
bullock, or even two men. These too were harnessed and sat untouched.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Beyond there were other rows of tents, where seven-foot- long
muskets—together with powder, bags of shot, and a wooden prong to rest the
barrel on when firing—were now being broken out and distributed to the
infantry. The men were being armed, but the camp itself was practically without
fortification.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth stood brooding about the preparations, about the
Rajput horn bow he had only barely learned to use—he was finally able to hit
the <i>todah</i>, practice target, a mound of earth piled near Jadar's
officers' tent, but shooting under a shield seemed impossible—and the situation
began to overwhelm him. Jadar's position was becoming more hopeless by the
minute.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He stared around the open camp and decided he would try to
requisition as many matchlocks as possible, and perhaps also try to teach
Shirin to shoot in the time remaining. If they had muskets, he told himself,
perhaps they could somehow defend themselves when the Imperial army swept
through the camp.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He turned and pushed his way back toward where muskets were
being issued. Men were walking past him carrying heavy matchlocks, five feet in
length with a barrel of rolled steel welded together end to end. The barrel was
attached to the stock by a broad steel band, and both were profusely ornamented
with embossing and colored enamel. Some of the muskets had wooden tripods
attached to the end of the barrel.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As he approached the munitions tent, he saw Vasant Rao
standing in its center, issuing orders with an easy smile, his moustache and
turban as prim as though he were on muster. Behind him was a head-high pile of
muskets, each wrapped in a roll of green broadcloth. Hawksworth stared at him
for a moment, then pushed forward. Through the shouting mob he finally managed
to catch the Rajput's arm and pull him toward the rear of the open tent.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Why aren't the cannon being deployed?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But they are, Captain.&quot; Vasant Rao stroked his
moustache and looked past Hawksworth's shoulder toward the next stack of
matchlocks.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But only the medium-bore guns, and even those have no
shot. Nothing else has been moved.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;By medium bore I assume you mean the <i>gau-kash</i>,
the ox-drawn cannon. That's true. But these things all take time.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You're spending what little time you have left
deploying medium-bore cannon, and those with no shot! Who the hell is in
charge?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Prince Jadar, of course. The <i>gau-kash </i>cannon are
the key to his strategy.&quot; Vasant Rao moved past Hawksworth and barked
orders for the next stack of muskets to be unstrapped. Waiting infantrymen in
ragged cloaks pushed forward. &quot;Take a musket, Captain, if you want one.
They're probably of some small use. When I'm finished here, I have to check all
the harness on the <i>fil-kash </i>cannon, the large guns that will be drawn
into position by elephants. Then I still have to issue the <i>mardum-kash </i>guns,
the small cannon that are assigned to two-man teams.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Where will this other artillery be deployed?&quot;
Hawksworth shouted toward Vasant Rao's back.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The Rajput seemed not to hear, as he paused to speak to one
of the men assisting him. Then he turned and unwrapped a musket, selected a
tripod, and passed both to Hawksworth. The other man was bringing a wide velvet
belt from the back of the tent, and he handed it to Hawksworth. Hanging from it
were a powder flask, bullet pouch, priming horn, match cord, and flint and
steel. &quot;The prince will issue orders for deployment of the <i>fil-kash </i>and
<i>mardum-kash </i>guns after they've all been harnessed.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;He'd better issue them soon. It'll start growing dark
in a couple of hours, three at most.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm sure he's aware of the time, Captain.&quot; Vasant
Rao turned and disappeared into a circle of bearded Rajputs, barking orders.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth watched him disappear, then turned and grabbed two
more muskets. Holding them ahead of him like a prow he pushed his way back into
the milling street. The air was rank with sweat and the crowds seemed more
disorganized than ever. Women jostled in the streets, haggling with the
merchants for clay jars of oil, while grooms moved among them leading prancing
horses, each wearing a gold-fringed saddle blanket that glowed like ancient
coin in the waning sun.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth studied the crowd, searching vainly for some sense
of organization, then turned to begin working his way back toward Jadar's
compound and his own tent.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Shirin was still there, asleep. He stood admiring her again,
her soft mouth, the olive skin of her high cheeks, her shining dark hair, and
realized he loved her more than ever.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Dear God, we've only just begun to live. Jadar is a madman.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Almost without knowing why, he began to rummage through the
remains of his clothing, still rolled in the carpet and lying where he had
thrown it. His pulse suddenly quickened when his fingers closed around a hard
round object. It was his very last bottle of brandy, miraculously entangled in
the remains of his formal doublet.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>If there was ever a time . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He ripped away the rotting cork with his teeth and pulled
deeply on the brandy, twice. As always, it seemed to work at the knot in his
gut. He took one more swallow, then shook Shirin.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She startled awake and stared at him wildly for a second.
Then she broke into a smile . . . until she saw the brandy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Do you really need that now?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I need this and a lot more. How can you sleep? This
whole God-cursed camp is going to be leveled by the Imperial army in a few
hours.&quot; He stopped and stared at her. &quot;Are you listening? Only a
fraction of Jadar's cannon are deployed. Most are still waiting to be pulled
into position. It's unbelievable.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Shirin pulled herself up and leaned against a bolster,
examining him with weary eyes. &quot;Then why are you here? I</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>thought
you'd decided to help Prince Jadar.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;How can anyone help him when he won't help
himself?&quot; Hawksworth took another burning mouthful of brandy and stared at
his bow quiver lying on the carpet. In a fit of disgust he kicked it toward the
center of the tent.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Shirin watched the bow fall and laughed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Have you mastered your Rajput bow yet?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;No, and what does it matter? You know Jadar is
outnumbered three to one.&quot; Hawksworth pointed toward the muskets he had
leaned against a coil of rope by the tent pole. &quot;I've got three weapons
for us. Do you think you can shoot a matchlock?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I can shoot a bow.&quot; She dismissed the muskets with
a glance. &quot;I sincerely hope you've learned enough to shoot one too.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>A trumpet sounded from the center of the compound.
Immediately it was answered by others the length of the camp.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Shirin snapped alert and rose off the bolster, pulling her
gauze cloak around her waist.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That's the signal to begin preparing the firewood.
Come. At least you can help with that.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth examined her aghast.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Firewood! What in God's name are you talking about? Is
Jadar planning to light fires? Is he worried the Imperial army won't find our
camp?&quot; He turned and walked to the doorway, rubbing his brow in disbelief.
&quot;I think there's damned small risk of that. The red tents of his <i>zenana
</i>can be seen for miles.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Shirin laughed and pushed her way ahead of him, past
the portiere of the tent. Servants had already begun assembling piles of logs
along the center of the walkway that ran the length of the compound. Hawksworth
stood at the doorway and stared in astonishment as clay jars of oil were
carried from the kitchen tent and stationed near the logs. As he watched, he
noticed the long shadows of dusk beginning to play across the walls of nearby
tents.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He turned to retrieve the brandy, and when he emerged again
from the tent, Shirin was lost among the crowd of servants bringing wood. He
slipped the bottle into his jerkin and started working his way down the side of
the compound, back toward the munitions tent.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Pairs of elephants had been harnessed to the larger cannon,
and now they were being led out of the camp, into the dusk. Following these
were camels with two-pound swivel guns mounted on their backs, together with
infantry pulling the smaller guns after them on two-wheeled carriages. Bullock
carts heaving with powder and shot came after.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Pyramids of firewood were scattered among the tents, and
already many of the Rajputs had assembled by the unlit piles, talking and
embracing. Some had seated themselves and removed their turbans, chanting
verses from the Bhagavad-Gita as they began to oil and comb their long black
hair. Hawksworth watched silently as they started passing around inlaid
teakwood boxes, taking and eating handfuls of small brown balls.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As he stood puzzling, he recognized Vasant Rao standing among
the men. The Rajput was somber now, clasping each of the men in what seemed a
farewell gesture. He looked up and saw Hawksworth and smiled.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Captain Hawksworth, I'm glad you're here. You're almost
a Rajput yourself by now. Do you want to comb your hair? It's how we prepare
for what may happen. Who knows which of us will see the morrow?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I can die just as well with my hair the way it
is.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then you're not entirely a Rajput after all. But you're
still welcome to join us.&quot; He held out one of the boxes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth opened the box and gingerly took out one of the
balls. As he rolled it under his nose, it triggered a distant memory of his
first night in Surat and Mukarrab Khan's dinner party. Suddenly he stopped dead
still.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It was opium.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Jesus Christ! Have you all gone mad?&quot; He flung the
ball to the ground and whirled on Vasant Rao. &quot;That's the last thing you
need if you hope to fight at all. It's like eating death.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Affion prepares a Rajput for battle, Captain. The more
we eat, the stronger we become. It gives us the strength of lions.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Good Jesus help us all.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth pushed his way incredulously back through the
milling crowd of infantry and mounted cavalry, feeling as though the world had
collapsed. All around him Rajputs were eating handfuls of opium, combing their
hair, embracing in farewell. Many had already put on their <i>khaftan</i>, the
quilted vest they wore under their armor. He wondered how long it would be
before they became drunk with opium and began killing each other.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>God, we're all going to die. Can't Jadar stop it?
Can't he at least stop them from eating opium before we're attacked? And where
are they moving the cannon? Out of the camp? What the hell is happening?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He wheeled and headed for the <i>naqqara-khana</i>, the entry
to Jadar's compound. When he reached it, he realized the guards were gone.
Amazed, he walked through the entry and discovered all the interior partitions
of the gulal bar were also gone. The satin tents that had held the melons, the
pan leaves, the kitchen—all were deserted, empty.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He made his way on through the deserted gulal bar, feeling
like a man lost. In the dark there were no guards, no troops, nothing. Ahead he
heard the sound of elephants trumpeting and he felt his way forward through the
semi-darkness, the ground a mosaic of flickering shadows from the still-burning
camp light. His despair absolute, he reached into the pocket of his jerkin for
the bottle.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>A katar was at his throat.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It's forbidden by death to draw a weapon in the <i>gulal
bar</i>, Captain.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I was only . . .&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>There was an explosion of laughter and he turned to see the
shadowed face of Jadar.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;What . . . what are you doing here?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Thinking, Captain Hawksworth. Do you never think before
a battle at sea? Surely you must.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I think. And I also keep my gunners sober.&quot;
Hawksworth</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>felt vaguely
foolish as he finished extracting the brandy bottle. &quot;Do you know half
your men are eating handfuls of opium?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm glad to hear it. It means my Rajputs will be
invincible tomorrow.&quot; Jadar flipped the katar in his hand and dropped it
into is leather sheath. &quot;By the way, I understand you failed to master the
bow. But let's talk about something more important. Perhaps you can be of help
after all. I'm sure you realize. Captain, that a commander must always
understand two things. He must know his own strengths, and he must know the
strengths of those who oppose him. But he can really only know one of these for
sure. He can never know exactly what he will meet.&quot; Jadar paused.
&quot;Tell me, if you were Inayat Latif, how would you deploy the Imperial army
tomorrow?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What do you mean?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;How would you choose to attack? The position of
infantry, cavalry, elephants is never exactly the same in any battle. For
example, often the front line is held by rows of infantry. The first row will
be men wearing plate armor— which is much heavier than the usual steel
netting—forming a protective wall with special broad shields. They are always
excellent archers. Behind these will be another row, wearing only helmets and
breastplates, and armed with swords and pikes. The third row is infantry with
swords, bows, and axes. The fourth carries lances and swords. The rows are
segmented, so those behind can see ahead, and cavalry can get through.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That deployment would mean a slow-moving attack, and a
very bloody fight.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Precisely. That's why many commanders prefer to use
their cavalry as the vanguard. Horsemen can move faster, and they can more
easily avoid defense barricades.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth looked at Jadar, wishing he could see his eyes.
&quot;But cavalry can be cut to ribbons with small artillery. Is it wise to
charge with your cavalry if your enemy has heavy gun emplacements?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He heard Jadar laugh. &quot;You may make a commander yet. You
see, Inayat Latif will naturally assume our camp is</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>heavily
defended. Now although it's considered questionable manners to attack a camp at
night, your manners become excusable if you attack at early dawn, even though
it's still dark. I've known of attacks occurring almost half a <i>pahar </i>before
dawn. What's that in European measure? An hour, an hour and a half?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But if it's still dark, how can you see the enemy's
lines?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You can see them if your enemy's camp has been
negligent enough to leave a few fires burning.&quot; Jadar smiled as he paused
to let the words sink. &quot;But now let's examine the third possibility. Leading
the attack with your elephants. Elephant armor is steel plate and it can
withstand everything except heavy cannon. If you can entice your foe into
firing his biggest artillery before you charge, then you can send a wave of war
elephants and devastate his gunners before their cannon cool enough to reload.
Since it can take at least half a <i>pahar </i>for a large cannon to cool,
large guns are rarely fired more than once in a battle. And never after your
cavalry has moved out. Leading the vanguard with war elephants always entails
danger, since if they panic, they can turn around and trample your own
infantry, but in this case it's probably worth the risk.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And you think that's what Inayat Latif will try to
do?&quot; Hawksworth absently twirled the brandy bottle in his hand.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm asking you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It sounds the most plausible. He'll position his
biggest cannon to fire into the camp, and after he's drawn your fire in return,
he'll stampede about a thousand war elephants right through here, crushing
everything in their path. Including your opium-sotted Rajputs and their
invincible bows.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You're doing remarkably well so far, Captain.&quot;
Jadar took Hawksworth's arm and guided him toward the back of the compound.
&quot;And then what would you do?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;I'd send an infantry wave right after the war
elephants, with lines so thick it would be a wall of death. And behind them I'd
have cavalry, with muskets, to contain the camp and meet your own cavalry when
it broke through—as it probably would eventually.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Cavalrymen wouldn't bother with muskets, just bows, but
you're still thinking very clearly. Now tell me, from what direction would you
attack this particular camp?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>They were approaching the tents, where servants were
beginning to soak the wood piles with oil. Hawksworth found himself astonished
that Jadar would listen calmly to the strategy spelling his own destruction.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;From the east, the way we came in.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And why that particular direction?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Several reasons.&quot; Hawksworth tried to remember the
terrain as they came into the camp. &quot;First, if I'd marched from the east,
I'd already have my army deployed there. Second, and probably more important,
it's the only direction that's really accessible. The other sides are too
forested. But from the east there's a wide clearing that funnels down right
into the perimeter of the camp.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;With a very clear demarcation of forest on each side,
which helps keep your army grouped.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Correct. And, also, the sun would not be in my men's
eyes if I hit you from the east.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Jadar stopped and looked at him. &quot;So that is precisely
what you would do? Attack at dawn on the eastern perimeter. And lead with a
front line of war elephants?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;With the biggest and best I had.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Jadar sighed. &quot;You know, it troubles me that a <i>feringhi
</i>would conclude the same thing I have. But I think it's a classic problem.
And that will dictate a classic solution in the mind of Inayat Latif, whose
alleged brilliance does not include a flair for originality. He'll have to
mount a conventional attack. What's more, because of the restricted terrain,
he'll have no room to split his army into a right wing and a left wing. They'll
have to be a single phalanx. That's dangerous if you ever need to retreat, but
he'll not even consider that possibility. And you say you also believe he'll
hold his cavalry for the third wave.&quot; Jadar paused. &quot;That's more
important here than you probably realize. Everything else depends on it. The
cavalry must attack last.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It seems best. And his cavalry is mainly Rajput. He'll
not risk cutting up his finest troops by sending them in the first attack wave,
when your artillery is still in place.&quot; Hawksworth hesitated, then
continued bitterly. &quot;Or should be.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>       
Jadar laughed and looked at Hawksworth, then at his bottle.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>&quot;What's
that in your hand. Captain?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent2>&quot;A bottle of brandy. Spanish, I'm ashamed to
admit, but it's still the best.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;May I try it?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Jadar took the bottle and gingerly swallowed a swig. He stood
motionless for a moment and then coughed violently.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Merciful Allah! Now I understand why the Prophet
forbade its use.&quot; He shoved back the bottle. &quot;But I wanted to drink
once with you, Captain. I'm told it's a European custom. You've eased my
mind.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Eased your mind! I just told you how your camp will be
devastated at sunrise.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Absolutely. I will regret losing these tents.&quot;
Jadar's tone grew pensive. &quot;You know, some of them have been with me since
my first campaign in the Deccan, years ago.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;How about your Rajputs? And your women? Will you regret
losing them as much as your tents?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I don't expect to lose them.&quot; Jadar took
Hawksworth's arm and led him around the last tent. In the firelight baggage
elephants were being loaded with women from the <i>zenana</i>. The elephants
were covered with <i>pakhar </i>armor, steel plates around the sides of their
bodies and a special steel casement for their head and trunk. The women were
being helped up tall ladders and into their elephants' <i>howdah</i>, an
octagonal box of heavy boards strengthened with iron plate.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Why are you loading the women now?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But we're leaving, Captain.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth stared at him speechlessly for a moment, then
noticed Shirin walking toward them, carrying a bow and two quivers of arrows.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You're leaving?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent2>&quot;You just predicted this camp would be
devastated. I agree with you entirely. In fact I planned it that way. So why
should anyone be here when it happens? The camp will be empty by dawn, Captain.
Naturally we had to wait until dark to move out. And continue work on the
trenches until the very end. Inayat Latif undoubtedly has scouts all around.
But by dawn there'll only be smoldering fires here. And the troops needed to
man our decoy cannon across the eastern perimeter. I've loaded half the cannon
with elephant barbs made in my workshops. The other half with nothing. Why
waste shot? We'll fire the blank cannon to induce them to charge, and after the
elephants have come inside cannon range, we'll shoot the barbs in among them. A
barb in the foot of an elephant can immobilize it completely. Inayat Latif will
never expect barbs. They haven't been used in India for fifty years. His war
elephants should be contained right out there, unable to advance or
retreat.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But where will your army be?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Captain. Just when I thought you were beginning to
understand tactics. My army will be waiting along both sides of the open plain
on the east, behind a foliage camouflage we've been erecting over the past two
weeks. After the attack force of Imperial war elephants has been funneled into
the empty camp, we will open fire against them with our biggest cannon. From
both sides. The medium-range cannon will fire into the infantry, as will the
small artillery. All the guns should be in place just before dawn if I've timed
it right.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth turned to see keepers leading an armored elephant
forward for him and Shirin. Only its ears could be seen behind the steel plate.
Then he looked again at Jadar.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But you're still outnumbered in infantry three to
one.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;All things in time, Captain.&quot; He turned and
embraced Shirin lightly. &quot;This was my best <i>swanih-nigar</i>. Guard her
well.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Shirin examined Hawksworth's brandy bottle with her dark eyes
and laughed skeptically. &quot;I've brought my own bow.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth cleared his throat as he slipped the bottle back
into his jerkin. &quot;I've requisitioned a brace of muskets. It's still the
weapon I prefer.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Congratulations, Captain.&quot; Jadar's laugh was
cynical. &quot;I admire your <i>feringhi</i> initiative. But I don't want to
see you harmed. Like I told you, I'm sending you with the <i>zenana</i>. 
They'll be moved to that hilltop there west of the camp. So at least you'll be
able to watch the battle.&quot; He turned to leave. &quot;Farewell until
tomorrow, Captain. May Allah ride with you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And I wish you Godspeed. You're a ten times better
strategist then I realized, for whatever it may be worth.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Jadar laughed. &quot;Just save some of your foul-tasting <i>feringhi
</i>brandy for our victory celebration. And perhaps I'll drink with you one
more time.&quot; His eyes darkened. &quot;If not, then tomorrow we'll be eating
lamb side by side in Paradise.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>       A
drum roll lifted across the dark plain, swelling in intensity like angry, caged
thunder. It rose to fill the valley with a foreboding voice of death, then
faded slowly to silence, gorged on its own immensity.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That's the Imperial army's call to arms. Prince Jadar
was right. Inayat Latif is attacking now, before dawn.&quot; Shirin was seated
next to Hawksworth in the dark <i>howdah</i>. She rose to peer over the
three-foot-high steel rim, out into the blackness. Around them were the shapes
of the <i>zenana </i>guard elephants, silently swinging their trunks beneath their
armor. The <i>zenana </i>waited farther back on female baggage elephants,
surrounded by hundreds of bullock carts piled with clothing and utensils.
&quot;Merciful Allah, he must have a thousand war drums.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You saw the size of the Imperial army mustering at
Fatehpur.&quot; Hawksworth rose to stand beside her, grasping the side of the
rocking <i>howdah </i>and inhaling the cold morning air. &quot;The queen had
begun recalling <i>mansabdars </i>and their troops from every province.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Suddenly a chorus of battle horns cut through the dark, followed
by the drums again, now a steady pulse that resounded off the wooded hills,
swelling in power.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That's the signal for the men and cavalry to deploy
themselves in battle array.&quot; Shirin pointed toward the sound. &quot;The
Imperial forces are almost ready.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Below them fires smoldered in Jadar's abandoned camp, a
thousand specks of winking light. Although the east was beginning to hint the
first tinges of light, the valley where the Imperial army had massed was still
shrouded in black.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The drums suddenly ceased, mantling the valley in eerie,
portentous quiet. Hawksworth felt for Shirin's hand and noticed it perspiring,
even in the cold dawn air.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>From the eastern edge of Jadar's abandoned camp points of
cannon fire erupted, tongues of light that divulged the length and location of
the camp's defenses. A few moments later—less time than Hawksworth would have
wished—the sound reached them, dull pops, impotent and hollow. The firing
lapsed increasingly sporadic, until the camp's weak perimeter defense seemed to
exhaust itself like the last melancholy thrusts of a spent lover.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The defense perimeter of the camp had betrayed itself, and in
the tense silence that ensued Hawksworth knew the Imperial guns were being set.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Suddenly a wall of flame illuminated the center of the plain
below, sending rockets of fire plunging toward the empty camp.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Jesus, they're launching fireworks with cannon. What
are they?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I don't know. I've heard that cannon in India were once
called naphtha-throwers.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>A second volley followed hard after the first. Although this
time no fireworks were hurtled, the impact was even more deadly. Forty-pound
Imperial shot ripped wide trenches through the flaming tents of the prince's
camp. In moments the <i>gulal bar</i>, where they had been standing only hours
before, was devastated, an inferno of shredded cloth and billowing flame.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>A harsh chant began to drift upward from the valley, swelling
as voices joined in unison.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Allah-o-Akbar! Allah-o-Akbar!&quot; God is Great. It
was the battle cry of Inayat Latifs Muslim infantry.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The plain below had grown tinged with light now, as dawn
approached and the fires from Jadar's camp spread. As Hawksworth watched,
nervously gripping the handle of his sword, a force of steel-armored war
elephants advanced on the eastern perimeter of the camp, their polished armor
plate glowing red in the firelight. Those in the vanguard bore steel-shrouded <i>howdahs</i>,
through which a single heavy cannon protruded . . . probably a ten-pounder,
Hawksworth told himself. The steel <i>howdahs</i> on the next rows of elephants
were almost three feet high and perforated to allow their archers to shoot
without rising above the open top. Sporadic cannon and matchlock fire from the
few hundred men left in the camp pelted the elephants but did nothing to impede
their advance. Directly behind them the Imperial infantry swept in dense,
martialed ranks.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Jadar knew exactly what he was doing when he picked this
terrain for the camp, Hawksworth told himself. He used it to set the terms for
the battle. There's no room to maneuver. When they discover the camp is
abandoned, the elephants can't retreat and regroup without crushing their own
infantry.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He slipped his arm around Shirin's waist and held her next to
him. They watched as the Imperial war elephants crashed through the camp's
outer edge, scarcely slowing at the ditch. When the elephants were at
point-blank range, the specially loaded cannon along the perimeter opened fire,
spraying a rain of steel barbs among them. Even from the hilltop he could hear
the clang of steel as the barbs ricocheted off their armor.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We'll soon know if Jadar's plan has a chance. Can he
contain the elephants there, or will they obliterate the camp, then regroup,
and . . .&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The first row of elephants suddenly reared chaotically,
lashing out with their armored trunks and dismounting some of the gunners. As
barbs caught in their feet, they trumpeted in pain and started to mill randomly
in angry confusion, crushing several of the men they had thrown.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Just as Jadar predicted, the deadly carpet of barbs had temporarily
disrupted their advance. Their ranks were broken and their guns in disarray.
Behind the elephants the infantry still marched unaware, until the confusion in
the elephant ranks began to disrupt their front lines. Gradually the order in
the infantry ranks completely disintegrated, as the men stopped to eye the
milling war elephants ahead of them in growing fear and confusion. By a single
cannon salvo Jadar's men had robbed the attack of its momentum.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Now's Jadar's moment.&quot; Hawksworth watched in growing
admiration. &quot;Will he use it?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As though in answer, a blare of trumpets from the hills on
both sides of the plain suddenly electrified the morning air. As they died
away, the woods opened wide with a single chorus, deep and throaty and
unforgiving.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>RAM RAM. RAM RAM. RAM RAM.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It was the ancient Rajput war cry.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>A blaze of fire from Jadar's camouflaged cannon shredded away
the leafy blinds erected along the foot of the hills, sending a rain of
forty-pound lead shot into the Imperial war elephants. Their disordered ranks
erupted in tangled steel and blood. Seconds later, a volley by Jadar's small
artillery ripped into the unsuspecting infantry massed behind the elephants,
hurtling fragmented bodies and orphaned weapons spinning through the ranks.
Finally came the fiery streaks of rockets, thin foot-long iron tubes filled
with gunpowder and set with a lighted fuse, many with a sword blade attached to
the end, which cut in a deadly wave through the Imperial troops, slashing and
exploding as they flew.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>A dense roll of Jadar's war drums sounded from both
hillsides, and the first wave of Rajput cavalry, still bellowing their war cry,
charged down on the disrupted Imperial forces, discharging volleys of arrows
with mechanical precision. They wore steel-net cloaks and helmet guards, and
their horses were armored with woven steel netting encased in heavy
quilting—with a wide frontlet over the chest, a neck-length collar secured to
the top of the bridle, and a body shroud over their sides and hindquarters
emblazoned with each man's family crest. The startled infantry turned to meet
them, and in moments the air darkened with opposing arrows. From the hill above
came the din of supporting matchlock fire from Jadar's own infantry.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The Rajput cavalry plowed into the first rows of Imperial
infantry with their long <i>nezah </i>lances held at arm's length high above
their heads, thrusting downward as they rode. Veins fueled with opium, the
Rajputs had forgotten all fear. They brushed aside Imperial spears and swords
and slaughtered with undisguised pleasure, as though each death endowed more
honor to their <i>dharma</i>. Hawksworth's stomach knotted as he watched a
thousand men fall in less than a minute.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>While the Rajputs attacked, the prince's division of armored
war elephants had emerged from their camouflage and begun advancing across the
western edge of the plain, isolating the ragged remainder of the Imperial
elephants from the battlefield. Although Jadar had far fewer war elephants,
they now were easily able to contain the shattered Imperial forces.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth turned to watch as yet another wave of Jadar's
cavalry bore down on the plain. These rode through the tangle of Imperial
infantry wielding long curved swords, killing any the first wave had missed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm not sure I believe what I'm seeing.&quot;
Hawksworth peered through the dust and smoke boiling across the plain below.
&quot;Jadar has already seized the advantage. He's immobilized their war
elephants, their major advantage, and he timed the counterattack
perfectly.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The battle has only just begun.&quot; Shirin took his
hand for no reason at all and gripped it. &quot;And their major advantage was
not elephants, but numbers. I fear for him. Look, there.&quot; She pointed
toward the east, where the red sky now illuminated a vast sea of infantry,
poised as reinforcements. &quot;The prince's Rajputs cannot stop them all.
Prince Jadar does not have the forces to meet them. I think he will be defeated
today, badly.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And if he dies, do we die with him?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Perhaps not you. But they will surely kill me. And
probably Mumtaz. Most certainly they have orders to kill his son.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>On the field below Jadar's cavalry fought as though
possessed. Rajputs with one, two, even three arrows in their back continued to
sound their war cry and take head after bearded head, until they finally
slumped unconscious from the saddle. Riderless horses, many with their stomachs
slashed open, could be seen running wildly through the Imperial ranks, unused
arrows still rattling in their saddle quivers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Waves of Jadar's infantry had begun pouring down from the
hills, following the cavalry. The men wore heavy leather helmets and a skirt of
woven steel. A hood of steel netting hung down from each man's helmet,
protecting his face and neck. They advanced firing volley after volley of
arrows into the Imperial infantry. When they reached the plain, they drew their
long curved swords and, waving them above their heads, threw themselves into
the forces of Inayat Latif. The field quickly became a vast arena of
hand-to-hand combat, as inevitably happened when two Indian armies met, with
Jadar's forces badly outnumbered.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Shirin watched the slaughter in silence for a time, as though
tallying the dead and dying on both sides, and then she turned her face away.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Allah preserve us. Prince Jadar's Rajputs have eaten so
much affion I think they can fight even after they die, but their numbers are
already shrinking. How long can they protect the prince?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Where's he now?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She turned back and peered through the dust on the field for
a long moment. Then she pointed. &quot;He's on the field now. There, in the
center. Do you see him?&quot; She paused. &quot;He's very courageous to take
the field so early. It will inspire his men, but it's a very bad omen.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth squinted toward the east. He could barely make out
a phalanx of elephants moving across the plains, into the middle of the
fiercest fighting. Several of the elephants had clusters of two-pound swivel
guns mounted on their backs, a few had rocket launchers, but most carried
howdahs filled with Rajput archers. In the center moved a large black elephant,
heavily armored and bearing a steel <i>howdah </i>decorated with ornate
gilding. Standing erect in the howdah, beneath a huge embroidered umbrella, was
the figure of Prince Jadar, loosing arrows in rhythmic succession as the
Imperial infantry closed around him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Why is it a bad sign?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It's unwise for the supreme commander of an army to
expose himself so early in the battle.&quot; Shirin was watching Jadar,
transfixed. &quot;If he's killed, the battle will be over. All his troops will
flee.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Even his fearless Rajputs?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That's the way in India. If he's lost, what do they
have left to fight for? They will melt into the forest. In India a commander
must always be visible to his men, standing above the armor of his howdah, so
they'll know for certain he's alive.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As the circle of elephants surrounding Jadar advanced through
the field, a triple line of his Rajput infantry moved into place around him. He
quickly became the focus of the battle, and the Imperial infantry massed to
encircle him, like the king in a game of chess. His protective buffer of
elephants was coming under increasingly heavy attack. The advantage of surprise
enjoyed by his original offensive was gone. Now he was clearly on the
defensive.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I think Jadar's starting to be in serious trouble. You
were right. I don't know how much longer his circle of elephants can protect
him.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>In the silence he slowly turned to Shirin and their eyes met.
Nothing more was said because no more words were needed. She reached out and
touched his lips and a lifetime seemed to flow between them. Then he drew his
sword and leaned over the edge of the howdah.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Yes.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>With a single stroke he severed the tether rope tying their
elephant. Their startled mahout turned and stared in disbelief. When Hawksworth
shouted at him to start, he hesitated for a moment, then flung his barbed iron <i>ankus
</i>into their <i>howdah </i>and plunged for the grass.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth grabbed the <i>ankus</i>, but before he could
move, the elephant lifted its trunk into the morning air and emitted a long,
defiant trumpet. Then he plunged past the tethered <i>zenana </i>elephants and
broke into a gallop, eastward down the hill and directly toward the battle.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth staggered backward and grasped the side of the
swaying <i>howdah</i>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;How . . . how did he know?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Prince Jadar didn't give us a baggage elephant. He gave
us one of his personal war elephants. To protect you. He knows where he should
be now.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>In only minutes their elephant reached the edge of the plain
and began advancing like a dreadnought through the swarm of Imperial infantry,
headed directly for Jadar. Any luckless infantryman caught in his path would be
seized in his trunk and flung viciously aside, or simply crushed beneath his
feet.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But how could he know Jadar's threatened?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;He knows. His whole life is to protect the
prince.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>A steel arrowhead sang off the side of the howdah. Then
another thudded into one of the wooden beams supporting the armor. Hawksworth
grabbed Shirin and shoved her down, below the steel rim. She fell sprawling and
turned to grab their bows. As Hawksworth took them and began to notch the
string on each one, he noticed for the first time that Jadar had given them one
of his combat <i>howdahs</i>, with firing holes all around the sides.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>War cries and sounds of steel on steel ranged around
them as they advanced, but their elephant seemed oblivious, only beginning to
slow when they approached the dense lines of Imperial infantry encircling
Jadar.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth found his bow ring and slipped it awkwardly over
his right thumb. Then he strung an arrow and took aim through one of the firing
holes in the side of the howdah. The arrow sang off his thumb and glanced
harmlessly against the steel net cloak of an Imperial infantryman. The man
looked up, then paused to aim an arrow at the howdah. It was a lethal decision.
Their elephant turned and seized him as he took aim, flinging him down and
crushing him under its foot with a single motion. At once the Imperial infantry
again started to clear a path in front of them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Jesus, I see why elephants are so feared on a battlefield.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Yes, but they cannot fight the entire battle . .
.&quot; Shirin's voice trailed off as she stared through a hole in the side of
the <i>howdah</i>. Suddenly her eyes flooded with fear. &quot;Oh, Allah!
Merciful Allah! Look!&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>A close-ranked formation of Imperial horsemen, perhaps fifty
in number, was advancing toward them from the eastern perimeter of the plain.
They wore body armor of black steel and they ignored the infantry battling
around them as they charged directly for the circle of Jadar's elephants.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Who are they?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I think they're Latifs special Bundella guards. I've
only heard about them. His elephant must be near and he's ordered them to
attack. He must realize the prince is vulnerable now. He hopes to kill Prince
Jadar in a quick action and so end the battle.&quot; She stared over the side
of the steel <i>howdah </i>again. &quot;If they fail, then he will send his
regular Rajput cavalry.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What's so special about Bundellas?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;They're from the region of Bundelkhand, and their
horses are said to be specially trained against elephants. The native Bundellas
. . .&quot; She ducked down and stared wildly around the howdah as an arrow
grazed by. &quot;Where ... the matchlocks!&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth quickly pulled up one of the muskets and checked
the prime. He passed it to Shirin and took a second for himself. As he looked
again over the top of the <i>howdah</i>, he saw the elephants guarding Jadar
start turning to face the approaching horsemen. Their own elephant had now
reached the defense lines and it immediately assumed its normal place in the
protective circle.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Many of the approaching Bundellas were already being cut down
by the spears of the Rajput infantry, but over half managed to penetrate the
outer defense perimeter and reach the circle of elephants. The horsemen
immediately began firing rockets into Jadar's elephants from long bamboo tubes
they carried, intending to frighten them and disrupt their ranks.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As Hawksworth watched, three of Jadar's encircling war
elephants shied skittishly away from the fireworks, creating a momentary
opening in the line. Before the opening could be secured, two of the Bundella
cavalry dashed through the space. Once inside the defense perimeter, they
parted, one riding toward either side of Jadar's elephant. One of the horsemen
took careful aim with his bow and shot a barbed arrow connected to a line deep
into the steel-net armor of the mahout seated on the neck of Jadar's elephant.
The horseman quickly whipped the arrow's line around his saddle horn and reined
his mount. The horse seemed to know exactly what was expected, as it instantly
reared backward, unseating Jadar's mahout and toppling him into the dust.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As the mahout fell, his steel <i>ankus </i>clanged against
Jadar's <i>howdah</i>, momentarily distracting the prince. When he whirled to
look for his mahout, the other Bundella spurred his stallion alongside the
elephant's rump, lifting a heavy spear above his head. But instead of hurtling
the spear toward Jadar he turned and plunged it deep into the ground beside the
elephant.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Shirin, what's he doing? How can . . . ?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The horseman twirled his long reins around the shaft in a
quick motion, tethering the horse. Then he balanced himself atop the saddle,
unsheathed his sword, and with an agile leap landed on the armored rump of
Jadar's elephant.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He secured his balance in less than a second, then grabbed
the side of Jadar's gilded <i>howdah</i>. Hawksworth stared spellbound as a
rain of Rajput arrows glanced harmlessly off his black steel body armor.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Now!&quot; Shirin's voice was almost a scream.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As though in a dream, Hawksworth leveled the long barrel of
his matchlock against the rim of the <i>howdah </i>and took aim. The stock felt
alien and bulky in his grip, and its lacquer inlay smooth and cold. He saw
Shirin thrust her own musket alongside his own, struggling to keep its heavy
barrel balanced. As the horseman raised his sword to plunge it into Jadar's
exposed back, Hawksworth squeezed the gun's inlaid trigger.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The stock kicked into his face and a burst of black smoke
momentarily blinded him. Shirin's matchlock had discharged at the same moment,
and he looked down as she tumbled backward against the padded side of the
howdah, still grasping the gun's heavy stock.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then he heard a cheer from the Rajputs and turned in time to
see the Bundella spin in a half circle. Hawksworth realized one musket ball had
caught him directly in the face, the other in the groin. He vainly reached to
seize the side of Jadar's <i>howdah </i>to regain his balance, but his foot
skidded and he slipped backward . . . into a forest of Rajput spears. The flash
of a sword took his head. Jadar had never seen him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>That settles one debt, you cocky bastard.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>There were shouts from the other attackers still outside the
defense perimeter and two horsemen reined their mounts and charged toward
Hawksworth and Shirin. As they approached, the elephant began revolving to meet
them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth reached down and grabbed the last remaining musket
and rose to fire.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As he looked up, he stopped in astonishment, for a second
refusing to believe what he saw.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Both Bundelkhand horses were advancing on their hind legs,
rearing and bounding toward them in high leaps. He watched transfixed as one of
the Bundellas discharged his bow past the neck of his horse, directly at the <i>howdah</i>.
The arrow missed Shirin's dust-covered hair by only inches.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth lifted his matchlock and leveled it against the
rim, wondering for an instant whether to aim for the man or the horse. Then the
matchlock blazed and he watched the horseman buckle backward in the saddle,
toppling into a circle of waiting Rajput swords.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Suddenly the howdah shuddered, throwing him sprawling against
the side. As he pulled himself up, he realized the other horse had secured its
front feet against the side of their elephant. The Bundella was staring
directly in his face, pulling an arrow from his saddle quiver.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The horseman's bow was already half drawn when Hawksworth
heard the sing of a bowstring beside him. As he watched, the end of a shaft
suddenly appeared in the right</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>cheek of the
Bundella, buried to the feathers. The horseman's own arrow slammed into the
side of the <i>howdah</i>, and he reached to claw at his face with his saddle
hand, forfeiting his grip. As he slipped backward off the rearing horse, the
Rajput infantrymen beheaded him in midair.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth turned to see Shirin drop her bow onto the floor
of the <i>howdah</i>. She slumped against the steel side, her eyes glazed with
incredulity at what she had done.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>They watched wordlessly as the perimeter of Jadar's elephants
was again drawn together and secured. As the other horsemen were driven back, a
coherent defense barricade of concentric circles was gradually established
around the prince. The outer perimeter was a line of Rajput infantry armed with
long spears. Inside their line were Rajput swordsmen, who now had linked
together the skirts of their long, steel-mesh cloaks to form a solid barrier.
And inside these was the last defense line, the circle of armored war
elephants.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As their own elephant instinctively rejoined the line
protecting Jadar, Hawksworth reached to touch Shirin's hand. As he did, he
noticed her thumb was bleeding and realized for the first time she had not been
supplied a bow ring.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I think we can hold off the infantry with the
elephants. But I don't know how long . . .&quot; Her voice trailed off as he
looked up at her face. She was leaning against the side of the <i>howdah</i>,
pointing wordlessly toward the east.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He turned to see a vast wave of the Imperial Rajput horsemen
bearing down on their position. They numbered in the thousands.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;God Almighty.&quot; He reached weakly for another
arrow, trying to count those remaining in the quiver and asking if he would
live long enough to shoot them all. &quot;It's over.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Their battle cry lifted above the plain as the approaching
cavalry neared the edge of the massed Imperial infantry engulfing Jadar. They
began advancing directly through the infantry, not slowing, heading straight
for Jadar.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth notched an arrow and rose up in the <i>howdah</i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>to take aim.
He drew back the string and picked the man in the lead for the first arrow.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As he sighted the Rajput's bearded face down the shaft, he
suddenly froze.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The Rajput had just driven the long point of his spear into
an Imperial infantryman.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth lowered his bow in disbelief and stared as the
approaching Imperial cavalry began cutting down their own infantry, taking heads
as they rode toward Jadar, leaving a carpet of death in their bloody wake.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Holy Jesus, what's happening? They're attacking their
own troops! Are they sotted with opium too?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Suddenly their chant of &quot;Ram Ram&quot; was taken up by
the Rajputs surrounding Jadar, and they turned on the Imperial infantry nearest
them with the ferocity of a wounded tiger.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Today Allah took on the armor of a Rajput.&quot; Shirin
slumped against the side of the howdah and dropped her bow. &quot;I had prayed
they would all one day join with the prince, but I never really believed it
would happen.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Jadar's circle of war elephants began to cut their way
through the remaining infantry to join the Rajput forces, swivel guns blazing
from their backs. In what seemed only minutes his entourage merged with the
vanguard of Rajput cavalry, and together they moved like a steel phalanx
against the Imperial infantry reserves waiting in the east.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth watched as the Imperial lines were cut, separating
the infantry fighting on the plain from their reserves. Next a corps of Rajput
horsemen wielding long spears overran the Imperial gun emplacements, then
grouped to assault the Imperial command post. When the elephant bearing the
banner of Inayat Latif started for higher ground, discipline in the Imperial ranks
evaporated.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>By late afternoon the outcome was no longer in
question. A final attempt by the Imperial forces to regroup disintegrated into
a rout, with thousands of fleeing Imperial infantry falling before the swords
and spears of the Rajput cavalry. Only the merciful descent of dark enabled
Inayat Latif and his Imperial commanders to escape death at the hands of
pursuing Rajput archers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As Hawksworth rode with Jadar's entourage through the dusty,
smoke-shrouded battlefield, headed back for the camp, he felt he was witnessing
the gaping mouth of hell. The plain was littered with the bodies of almost
forty thousand men and over ten thousand horses. The proud war cries were
forgotten. Through the dusky twilight came the plaintive moans of dying men and
the shrill neighing of shattered horses. Rajputs moved among the bodies,
plundering the dead enemy, searching for fallen comrades, dispatching with
their long swords any lingering men or horses who could not be saved.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>All because of Jadar, Hawksworth thought, and his stomach
sickened. Now what will happen? Jadar won the day in this valley, in the middle
of nowhere, but the Moghul is still in Agra, and tonight he still rules India.
And I think he'll still rule India, if only in name, till the day he dies. Jadar
can't march against the Red Fort in Agra, not with this ragtag army. Even his
division of Rajput defectors couldn't storm that fortress. I'm not sure God
himself could take the Red Fort. So what now, noble Prince Jadar? So far you've
merely brought death to half the fighting men in India.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The torchbearers marching four abreast at the front of their
elephants were now approaching the remains of the camp. Through the flickering
light emerged the vision of a burned-out ruin. Scorched furrows from the first
Imperial cannonade trailed between, among, through the few remaining tents.
Small clusters of wounded men, some begging for water and some for death, were
being fed opium and their wounds wrapped with the shreds of ripped-apart tents.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Jadar moved through the camp, acknowledging the triumphant
cheers of his men. Ahead his servants were already erecting a new chintz wall
around the <i>gulal bar </i>and replacing the tents for the <i>zenana</i>.
Hawksworth watched as carpets were unrolled from bullock carts and carried
inside the compound.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Jadar's elephant proceeded instinctively to the very entry of
the <i>gulal bar</i>, where it kneeled for him to dismount. Around him Rajputs
pushed forward to cheer and <i>teslim</i>. As he stood acknowledging them, the
other elephants also began to kneel. Jadar's servants rushed forward to help
Hawksworth and Shirin alight.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;This was the most horrible day I've ever known.&quot;
Her arms closed around his neck as her feet touched ground, and she held him
for a long moment, tears staining her cheeks. &quot;I've never before seen so
much killing. I pray to Allah I never see it again.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Hawksworth returned her embrace, then looked at her
sadly. &quot;There'll be a lot more before Jadar sees Agra, if he ever does.
This is just one battle, not the war. I'm not sure we want to be here to find
out how it ends.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She looked back at him and smiled wistfully in silence. Then
she turned and performed the <i>teslim </i>to Jadar.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The prince was scarcely recognizable. His helmet had been
torn by countless arrows, or matchlock fire, and his haughty face and beard
were smeared with dust and smoke. The emerald bow ring was missing from his
right thumb, which was now caked with blood. Beneath his armor the torn leather
of his right sleeve was stained blood-dark, where he had ripped out an arrow. As
he lifted his arms to acknowledge the rising cheers, his eyes were shadowed and
tired, but they betrayed no pain.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth turned and examined Jadar's <i>howdah</i>. It was
a forest of arrows and broken spear shafts. Grooms from the stables had already
brought water and sugarcane for his elephant and begun extracting iron
arrowheads from its legs and from a section of its right shoulder where its
armor had been shot away.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As he watched the scene, Hawksworth slowly became aware of a
pathway being cleared through the camp toward the east. Next, the cheers of
some of Jadar's Rajputs began to swell through the smoky air. Through the
encroaching dark, there slowly emerged the form of another elephant
approaching. In the torchlight he could tell it was regal in size and bore a
gilded <i>howdah </i>shaded by a wide brocade umbrella. There were no arrows in
the side of this <i>howdah</i>, nor was there more than a trace of dust on the
elephant's gilded and enameled armor. With its elaborate decoration of swinging
yak tails and tinkling bells, it seemed more suited for a royal procession than
for a battlefield.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Jadar watched impassively as the elephant neared the center
of the clearing. While the Rajputs around him stood at attention, the elephant
performed a small bow, then began to kneel with practiced dignity. Several
Rajputs rushed forward to help the rider alight.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The man's jeweled turban and rows of finger rings sparkled in
the torchlight. As he moved directly toward Jadar, Hawksworth suddenly
recognized the walk and caught his breath.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It was Nadir Sharif.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The prime minister paused a few feet from Jadar and salaamed
lightly. He did not <i>teslim</i>, nor did he speak. As he stood waiting, from
out of the darkness of the <i>gulal bar </i>the figure of a woman emerged. She
was veiled, surrounded by her women, and accompanied by a line of eunuchs
wearing sheathed scimitars in their waist sash. She stopped and performed the <i>teslim
</i>to Jadar. Then she turned to Nadir Sharif.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He stared at her for a long moment, then said something in
Persian. Without a word she lifted her veil and threw it back. Next she turned
and gestured to one of the servants standing behind her. The servant stepped
forward with a bundle wrapped in a brocade satin blanket and carried it
directly to Nadir Sharif.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The prime minister stood for a moment as though
unsure whether to take it. Finally he reached out and lifted the blanket from
the servant and cradled it against one arm. He stared down for a long moment,
his eyes seeming to cloud, and then he pushed back part of the blanket to examine
its contents more closely. With a withered finger, he reached in and stroked
something inside the blanket. Then he looked up and smiled and said something
to Jadar in Persian. The prince laughed and strolled to his side, taking the
blanket in his own smoke-smeared hands and peering down into it with Nadir
Sharif. They exchanged more words in Persian, laughed again, and then Nadir
Sharif walked to the waiting woman, whose dark eyes now brimmed with joy. He
stood looking at her for a long moment, then spoke to her in Persian and
enfolded her in his arms.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>A cheer went up again from the onlookers, as they pushed
forward to watch. Hawksworth turned to Shirin.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Is that who I think it is?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Shirin nodded, her eyes misting. &quot;It's Mumtaz, the first
wife of Prince Jadar and the only daughter of Nadir Sharif. He told Prince
Jadar he decided today he wanted to see his grandson, since he wanted to see
the face of the child who would be Moghul himself one day. Then he told Mumtaz
he will die in peace now, knowing that his blood will someday flow in the veins
of the Moghul of India.&quot; Shirin's voice started to choke. &quot;I can't
tell you what this moment means. It's the beginning of just rule for India.
Nadir Sharif knew that if Prince Jadar was defeated today, the child would be
murdered by Janahara. By defecting with his Rajputs, he saved Prince Jadar, and
he saved his grandson.&quot; She paused again. &quot;And he saved us too.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;When do you think he decided to do this?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I don't know. I still can't believe it's true.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth stopped for a moment, then whirled and seized her
arm. &quot;Jadar knew! By Jesus, he knew last night! The cavalry. He said the
cavalry had to be held to the last. He knew they would turn on the Imperial
infantry if he began to lose.<i> He knew all along</i>.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Shirin examined him with a curious expression.
&quot;I wonder if Mumtaz herself planned it. Perhaps she convinced Nadir Sharif
to save his grandson.&quot; She paused. &quot;This must have been the most
closely guarded secret in all of Agra. Nadir Sharif somehow kept even the queen
from knowing he would defect with the Rajputs or she would have surely killed
him.&quot; Shirin's voice trailed off as she pondered the implications.
&quot;He's astonishing. Janahara has never entirely trusted him, but somehow he
must have convinced her to let him command the Rajput cavalry. What did he do
to make her finally trust him?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Nadir Sharif embraced Mumtaz once more, then bowed lightly
again to Jadar and turned to leave. As his glance swept the torchlit crowd, he
noticed Hawksworth. He stopped for a second, as though not believing what he
saw, then broke into a wide smile.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;By the beard of the Prophet! Can it be? My old
guest?&quot; He moved toward Hawksworth, seeming not to notice Shirin.
&quot;May Allah preserve you, Ambassador, everyone at court thinks you've fled
India. For your sake I almost wish you had. What in God's name are you doing
here?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Someone tried to murder me at Fatehpur.&quot;
Hawksworth turned and took Shirin's arm. &quot;And Shirin. It seemed like a
good time to switch sides.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Someone actually tried to kill you? I do hope you're
jesting with me.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Not at all. If Vasant Rao and his men hadn't appeared
in time to help us, we'd both be dead now.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Nadir Sharifs eyes darkened and he looked away for a moment.
&quot;I must tell you that shocks even me.&quot; He turned back and smiled.
&quot;But I'm pleased to see you're still very much alive.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth studied Nadir Sharif for a moment. &quot;Do you
have any idea who might have ordered it?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;This world of ours is fraught with evil,
Ambassador.&quot; Nadir Sharif shook his head in resignation. &quot;I sometimes
marvel any of us survive it.&quot; Then he looked back at Hawksworth and
beamed. &quot;But then I've always found you to be a man blessed with rare
fortune, Ambassador. I think Allah must truly stand watch over you night and day.
You seem to live on coincidences. I was always amazed that just when His
Majesty ordered you out of Agra, the Portuguese decided to seize one of His
Majesty's personal cargo vessels and by that imprudent folly restored you to
favor. Now I hear you were attacked in the Fatehpur camp by some scurrilous
hirelings . . . at the very moment the prince's Rajputs just happened to be
nearby to protect you. I only wish I enjoyed a small portion of your
luck.&quot; He smiled. &quot;But what will you be doing now? Will you be joining
with us or will you stay with the prince?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What do you mean?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I understand His Highness is striking camp tomorrow and
marching west for the Rajput city of Udaipur. The new <i>maharana </i>there, a
distinguished if somewhat renegade Rajput prince named Karan Singh, apparently
has offered his lake palace as a refuge for the prince.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I don't seem to have much choice. I'm probably no more
welcome in Agra right now than you are.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Nadir Sharif examined him quizzically for a moment.
&quot;I'm not sure I understand exactly what you mean.&quot; Then he broke into
laughter. &quot;Ambassador, surely you don't assume I had anything to do with
the tragedy today. The honest truth is I used every means at my command to
dissuade the Rajput cavalry from their insidious treachery. They absolutely
refused to heed anything I said. In fact, I actually tried to forewarn Her
Majesty something just like this might happen.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What are you talking about!&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Their betrayal was astonishing, and I must tell you
frankly, entirely unaccountable. I intend to prepare a complete report for Her
Majesty. But this is merely a temporary setback for us, never fear.&quot; He
turned and bowed lightly to Shirin, acknowledging her for the first time.
&quot;I really must be leaving for the Imperial camp now. We've scheduled a war
council tonight to plan our next strategy.&quot; He smiled. &quot;I feel I
should counsel you once again that you've chosen very unsavory company. Prince
Jadar is a thorough disgrace to the empire.&quot; He bowed lightly once more to
Hawksworth, then to Shirin, and turned to remount his elephant. &quot;Good
night, Ambassador. Perhaps someday soon we'll drink <i>sharbat </i>together
again in Agra.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Even as he spoke, his elephant rose and began to move out.
His last words were drowned by cheering Rajputs.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;He'll never get away with it.&quot; Hawksworth watched
incredulously as the elephant began delicately picking its way through the
shattered camp.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Oh yes he will. You don't know Nadir Sharif as I
do.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Hawksworth turned to stare in bewilderment at Jadar.
The prince was standing next to Mumtaz, their faces expressionless. As Nadir
Sharif’s elephant disappeared into the dark, Mumtaz said something in Persian
and gestured toward Shirin. She replied in the same language and they moved
together, embracing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Your face is still fresh as the dawn, though your <i>kohl
</i>is the dust of war.&quot; Mumtaz's Persian was delicate and laced with
poetic allusions. She kissed Shirin, then looked down and noticed her right
hand. &quot;And what happened to your thumb?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I had no bow ring. You know we aren't supposed to
shoot.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Or do anything else except bear sons.&quot; Mumtaz
flashed a mock frown in the direction of Jadar. &quot;If I would let him, His
Highness would treat me like some stupid Arab wet nurse instead of a
Persian.&quot; She embraced Shirin again and kissed her once more. &quot;I also
know you learned to fire a matchlock today.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;How did you find out?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Some of the Rajputs saw you shoot a Bundella horseman
who had breached their lines and reached His Highness' elephant. One of them
told my eunuchs.&quot; Her voice dropped. &quot;He said you saved His Highness'
life. I want to thank you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It was my duty.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;No, it was your love. I'm sorry I dare not tell His
Highness what you did. He must never find out. He's already worried about too
many obligations. You saw what just happened tonight with father. I think he's
very troubled about what price he may be asked to pay someday for what happened
today.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I must tell you the English <i>feringhi </i>also shot
the Bundella who had mounted His Highness' elephant.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Is he the one there?&quot; Mumtaz nodded discreetly
toward Hawksworth, who stood uncomprehending, his haggard face and jerkin
smeared with smoke. Her voice had risen slightly and now her Persian was
lilting again.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;He's the one.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Mumtaz scrutinized Hawksworth with a quick flick of her eyes,
never looking up. &quot;He's interesting. Truly as striking as I'd heard.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I love him more than my life. I wish you could know
him.&quot; Shirin's Persian was equally as genteel as that of Mumtaz.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But is he yet a worthy lover in your bed?&quot;
Mumtaz's smile was almost hidden. &quot;I sent your message to father about the
Hindu <i>devadasi</i>.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Shirin smiled and said nothing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then you must bring him with us to Udaipur.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;If His Highness will have us there.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;/ will have you there.&quot; She laughed and looked
again at Hawksworth. &quot;If you'll tell me sometime what it's like to share
your pillow with a <i>feringhi</i>.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Captain Hawksworth.&quot; Jadar's martial voice rose
above the assembled crowd of congratulating Rajputs. &quot;Didn't I notice you
on the field today? I thought I had assigned you to guard my <i>zenana</i>. Are
you aware the punishment for disobeying orders in an army in India is immediate
beheading? Of if you like, I can have you shot from a cannon, as is sometimes
done. Which would you prefer?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Your cannon were mostly overrun. I guess you'll have to
behead me, if you can find anyone left with a sword sharp enough.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Jadar roared and pulled out his own sword. There was a deep
nick in the blade.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;By tomorrow I'm sure we can find one. In the meantime
I'll have to confine you in the <i>gulal bar </i>to prevent your escape.&quot;
He slipped the sword back into his belt. &quot;Tell me, did you manage to hit
anything today with your matchlocks?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Possibly. There were so many in the Imperial infantry I
may have succeeded in hitting someone.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Jadar laughed again. &quot;From the looks of her thumb, it
would seem the woman in your <i>howdah </i>did most of the shooting. I'm
astounded you'd permit her such liberty.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;She has a mind of her own.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Like all Persians.&quot; Jadar reached and lowered
Mumtaz's veil over her face. She let it hang for a moment, then shoved it back
again. &quot;Allah protect us.&quot; He turned and stared a moment into the
dark, toward the direction Nadir Sharif had departed. &quot;Yes, Allah protect
us from all Persians and from all Persian ambition.&quot; Then he suddenly
remembered himself and glanced back at Hawksworth. &quot;So tonight we may eat
lamb together after all, if there's one still to be found. But not yet in
Paradise. For that you will have to wait a few days longer.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth shifted uncomfortably. &quot;What exactly do you
mean?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Udaipur, Captain, tomorrow we strike camp and march for
Udaipur. It's a Rajput paradise.&quot; He turned and beckoned toward the Rajput
commander who had ridden from Fatehpur with them. &quot;It's time you met my
friend Mahdu Singh, brother of His Highness, Rana Karan Singh, the Maharana of
Udaipur. The <i>maharana </i>has generously offered us his new guest palace, on
his island of Jagmandir. It's on Pichola Lake, in the Rajput capital of
Udaipur. He was only just building the palace when I was there before, but I
seem to remember it's designed in a very interesting new style.&quot; He
glanced at Mumtaz. &quot;I think Her Highness will approve.&quot; Then he
continued. &quot;Rajputana, Captain, is beautiful. What's more, its mountains
are impregnable. I led the only Moghul army ever to escape defeat by the
Rajputs who live in those mountains. But today I have many loyal friends
there.&quot; Mahdu Singh bowed lightly to Hawksworth while Jadar watched in
satisfaction. &quot;His Highness, the Maharana, may decide to make a Rajput out
of you and keep you there, if you seem worth the trouble. Who can tell?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He turned and dismissed Mumtaz and her eunuchs with a wave.
He watched fondly as she disappeared into the <i>gulal bar</i>, then turned and
joined the waiting Rajputs. Together they moved out through the camp, embracing
and consoling.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Did you hear what he said?&quot; Hawksworth turned to
Shirin, who stood waiting, a light smile erasing some of the fatigue in her
face. &quot;He's planning to recruit another army of Rajputs. This war is only
beginning. Good Christ, when will it end?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;When he's Moghul. Nothing will stop him now.&quot; She
took his hand, and together they pushed through the shattered gulal bar toward
the remains of their tent.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>        The
advance of Prince Jadar's army west toward the Rajput stronghold of Udaipur was
like nothing Brian Hawksworth had ever seen. Jadar was marching into the heart
of ancient Rajput country, and the movement of his army suddenly came to
resemble a triumphant victory procession.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The heavy artillery formed the first contingent, drawn by
teams of elephants and bullocks. Two thousand infantry moved in front,
smoothing the ground with spades. The army's baggage animals followed the
artillery, and after this came Jadar's personal treasury—camels loaded with
gold and silver coin—together with his records and archives. Next in the line
of march were elephants carrying the <i>zenana </i>women's jewels and a
collection of ornate swords and daggers that Jadar periodically gave to his
officers as presents. Then came the water camels, and finally Jadar's kitchen
and provisions. The baggage was followed by the ordinary cavalry, and after
them rode Jadar and his retinue of nobles. Behind him came his <i>zenana</i>.
The rear of the procession was brought up by women and servants, then
elephants, camels, and mules carrying the remainder of the baggage and tents.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Some of Jadar's <i>zenana </i>women traveled in gilded <i>chaudols
</i>carried on the shoulders of four bearers and shaded with netting of colored
embroidered silk. Others were transported in enclosed palanquins, also covered
with silk nets decorated with gold fringe and tassels. Still others chose to
ride in swaying litters suspended between two elephants or two strong camels. A
female slave walked near each litter carrying a peacock tail to brush off dust
and keep away flies.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Jadar's first and favorite wife, Mumtaz, seemed to scorn all
these comforts, displaying herself regally all day long from atop her own
personal elephant, riding in a gold <i>howdah </i>shaded by a vast tapestry
umbrella. Her elephant was festooned with embroideries, yak tails, and large
silver bells; and directly behind her, on six smaller elephants, rode the women
of her immediate household. Her eunuchs rode clustered around her on horses,
each carrying a wand signifying his office and sweating profusely beneath his
jeweled turban. A vanguard of footmen with bamboo canes walked ahead of
Mumtaz's elephant clearing a path through the crowds.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Jadar himself traveled mainly on his favorite Arabian
horse—except when passing through cities, when he would switch to a
conspicuously bedecked elephant—surrounded by the high-ranking nobles. Trailing
out behind this first circle were the ranks of the lesser <i>mansabdars</i>,
who rode in full military dress, displaying swords, bows, shields. While this
procession inched along at its regal pace, Jadar and his nobles frequently
paused ostentatiously to bag tiger or chase stripe-eared antelope with the
prince's brace of hunting <i>chitahs</i>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>A complete set of tents for Jadar and his <i>zenana </i>traveled
a day ahead, to ensure that a fully prepared camp always awaited him and his
women when, at approximately three in the afternoon, the procession would stop
and begin to settle for the night. Each of his larger tents could be
disassembled into three separate sections, and all of these together required a
full fifty baggage elephants for transport. Moving the smaller tents required
almost a hundred camels. Wardrobes and kitchen utensils were carried by some
fifty mules, and special porters carried by hand Jadar's personal porcelains,
his gilt beds, and a few of his silk tents.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The procession was a lavish display of all the wealth and
arms Jadar had remaining. And nothing about it hinted that his was an army on
the run . . . which in fact it was.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth puzzled over Jadar's extravagant pomp for several
days, finding it uncharacteristic, and finally concluded it was a deliberate
Indian strategy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Jadar has to raise another army and quickly. He'll not do it
if he has the look of a fugitive and loser about him. He's managed to hold the
Imperial army at bay for a while, wound them enough to escape entrapment. But
he's wounded too, and badly. The Imperial army may be shattered for the moment,
but Jadar's lost half his own men. The winner will be the one who can rebuild
first and attack. If Jadar doesn't make some alliances and get some men soon,
Inayat Latif and the queen will chase him from one end of India to the other.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Along the way a few independent Rajput chieftains had come to
his banner, but not enough. When Hawksworth asked Shirin what she thought
Jadar's chances were of raising a Rajput army large enough to face Inayat
Latif, she had made no effort to conceal her concern.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The greatest Rajput nobles are waiting to see whether
Maharana Karan Singh of Udaipur will decide to openly support him. He's the
leader of the ranas of Mewar, which is the name for the lands of Rajputana
around Udaipur, and they're the highest in rank of all the Rajput chieftains of
India. If Maharana Karan Singh agrees to support him with his own army, the
other ranas of Mewar may follow, and after them perhaps all of Rajputana.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What do you mean? He's providing Jadar a place to stay,
or at least to hide while he licks his wounds. That looks like support to
me.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Shirin had tried to smile. &quot;Permitting Prince Jadar to
camp in Udaipur doesn't necessarily imply support. It could also be interpreted
merely as traditional Rajput hospitality. It's one thing to open your
guesthouse to a son of the Moghul. It's something quite different to commit
your army to aid his rebellion.&quot; She drew her horse closer to
Hawksworth's. &quot;You see, Maharana Karan Singh and his father Amar Singh
before him have had a treaty of peace with Arangbar for almost ten years, after
many decades of bloody war between Mewar and the Moghuls. There are many Rajput
chieftains in Mewar who do not want him to renounce that treaty. They're weary
of Moghul armies invading Rajputana and burning their fields and cities. Prince
Jadar will have to negotiate with Maharana Karan Singh if he's to be persuaded
to help. The prince will have to offer him something in return for his aid. For
the risk he'll be taking should the prince lose. That's why the other Rajputs
are waiting. Everyone here knows the prince has no chance if the maharana
withholds his support.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>A noticeable feeling of relief swept through the long columns
of Jadar's cavalry the afternoon that Maharana Karan Singh was sighted riding
out on his elephant, surrounded by a retinue of his personal guard, to welcome
Prince Jadar at the high stone gate leading through the walls of the mountain
city of Udaipur. Throughout the ranks of Jadar's bedraggled army it was seen as
a positive omen.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The army and the lesser <i>mansabdars </i>camped outside the
city walls; the highest-ranking nobles were invited to stay in the maharana's city
palace, set on a high cliff overlooking Pichola Lake; and Jadar, his <i>zenana</i>,
and his personal guards were ferried with much pomp across to the new guest
palace on Jagmandir Island, in the center of the lake. As one of Arangbar's
khans and a foreign ambassador, Brian Hawksworth was installed by the maharana
in a special suite in his city palace reserved for dignitaries.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>In an even more auspicious gesture, the maharana invited
Prince Jadar to dine with him in the palace that evening. The ancient Rajputana
tradition of hospitality did not normally require dining with your guests, and
the Rajput chieftains traveling with Jadar were again heartened. Late in the
afternoon, an invitation also arrived requesting that Ambassador Hawksworth and
Shirin, characterized as Jadar's personal aide, join the dinner.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Why do you think he wants us?&quot; When the maharana's
servants had left, Hawksworth showed the gilded invitation to Shirin. She was
on their balcony watching white-necked cranes glide across the surface of Pichola
Lake, spreading out hundreds of feet below them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Perhaps the maharana is curious to meet a <i>feringhi</i>.
I'm sure he's never seen one before.&quot; She hesitated. &quot;Or perhaps
Prince Jadar arranged for you to be there. To imply he has the support of the
English king's warships.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You know I don't speak for King James on matters of
war.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Tonight you must appear to do so. I'm sure your king
would help Prince Jadar if he knew him.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;He'll support him if he becomes Moghul.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then you must help Prince Jadar tonight. So that he
will.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Shirin had overseen the servants who had been sent to clean
and repair Hawksworth's doublet and hose. Then a bath was brought, accompanied
by barbers and manicurists. The maharana sent a vial of musk perfume to Shirin,
buried in a basket of flowers. By the time they were escorted through the high
scalloped archway leading into the palace banquet hall, they both were bathed,
perfumed, and refreshed; and Hawksworth again looked almost like an ambassador.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Accustomed to the red sandstone of Agra, he was momentarily
astounded to see a room fashioned entirely from purest white marble. The hall
was long and wide, with two rows of bracketed columns its entire length.
Maharana Karan Singh sat at the far end in front of a marble screen, his gold
wand of office at his side, reclining against an enormous bolster of gold
brocade. He appeared to be Jadar's age, with eyes that sparkled mischievously,
a long Rajput moustache, glistening with wax, which curled upward at the ends,
and a turban of gold brocade. He wore a long red and white striped satin skirt
beneath a translucent cloak. His necklace and earrings were matching green
emeralds. Seated around him, on red carpets woven with designs of fighting
elephants, were his Rajput nobles, each in white with an orange turban and a
gold-trimmed brocade sash at his waist. Every Rajput in the room had a
gold-handled katar.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Jadar saw Hawksworth and Shirin enter and rose to
greet them. The prince was dressed in his finest, with a cloak of gold cloth,
pale green trousers, red velvet slippers, a long double string of pearls around
his neck, and a pink silk turban crisscrossed with flowered brocade and secured
with a large ruby. He led Hawksworth before the maharana and introduced him, in
Rajasthani. Jadar then translated the introduction into Turki for Hawksworth,
who was startled to learn that he was a high-ranking member of
Angrezi—English—royalty. He looked around and realized he was easily the most
shabbily attired man in the room, including the servants.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>After the introduction Hawksworth took his place among
Jadar's own retinue of nobles. Shirin was seated on the carpet directly behind
him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>All the guests sat in a line facing a long gold-threaded
cloth spread along the floor. Food was brought in on silver trays, which were
placed on silver stools directly in front of each diner. Hawksworth had
scarcely taken his seat before a full wine cup was placed in his hands. It was
never allowed to approach dryness.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The banquet was lavish, equaling anything he had seen in
Agra. It was immediately apparent that roast game was the speciality of
Udaipur, as tray after tray of antelope, venison, hare, and wild duck were
placed before him. In its emphasis on roasted meats, the food could almost have
been English, save it was all seasoned with spices he had never tasted in
London. The centerpiece was an elaborately glazed wild boar the maharana had
bagged personally from horseback with a spear. Nominal Muslim though he was,
Prince Jadar downed a generous portion of the boar and praised the flavor.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The trays of meat were accompanied by spiced curds, local
yogurts, and baked vegetables swimming in ghee. The meal concluded with dried
fruits which had been sugared and perfumed, followed by mouth-freshening <i>pan</i>,
the betel leaves wrapped around spiced bhang, currants, sweet imported coconut.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The final offering, eagerly awaited by all the Rajputs, was
opium. As they popped down handfuls of the brown balls, Hawksworth discreetly
signaled for more wine. After the dishes were cleared, several jeweled women in
red trousers and thin billowing blouses entered, drank glasses of wine in honor
of the maharana, then danced among the guests to the accompaniment of a large
sarangi.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>After the dancers had been dismissed, Prince Jadar rose</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>and proposed
a toast to the maharana. The toast was ceremonial, elaborate, and—it
seemed—entirely expected by everyone.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;To His Highness, the Maharana of Udaipur: whose line
flows directly from the great Kusa, son of Rama, King of Ajodhya and the noble
hero of the Ramayana. Descendant of the Royal House of the Sun, whose subjects
will refuse their food if neither he nor his brother the Sun are present to
show their face upon it and bless it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The maharana's reply was equally effusive, describing Jadar
as the greatest Moghul warrior in all of history, the equal of his Mongol
forebears Genghis Khan and Tamerlane, a worthy descendant of the early Moghul
conquerors Babur and Humayun, and finally, the one Moghul whose martial skills
might actually approach those of the fighting Rajputs of Mewar—an oblique
reference to the fact that Jadar had led the Moghul army that subdued Mewar a
decade earlier and induced its Rajputs to finally acknowledge Moghul dominance
over northwest India.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Immoderate praise of one another's armies followed next. Then
the maharana said something else, and Jadar turned suddenly toward Hawksworth.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Ambassador Hawksworth. His Highness has asked to speak
with you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth rose from the carpet and moved forward. Around him
the Udaipur Rajputs studied him with open curiosity. They had listened to
lavish toasts for years, but none had ever before seen a <i>feringhi </i>in a
doublet. The very concept of such a phenomenon exceeded their imagination.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;His Highness has asked permission to allow his court
painters to make your portrait, so that he may remember your likeness. Dressed
as you are tonight. Do you have any objection?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Please tell His Highness I would be honored.&quot;
Hawksworth found himself startled, and unsure what reply was appropriate.
&quot;Please tell him that my own father was once a painter in England.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Jadar smiled through his teeth. &quot;You mean I should tell
him there are of course many skilled artists in your noble land of England.
Your own father, as we both know, was a great khan in England, not a lowly
craftsman.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As Hawksworth nodded dully, Jadar turned and translated this
to the maharana. Karan Singh's eyes brightened as he replied to Jadar.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;He asks if your king's painters are expert in
Ragamala?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm not entirely sure what His Highness refers
to.&quot; Hawksworth examined Jadar with a puzzled expression.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Jadar translated and the Rajput looked surprised. He turned
and quickly said something to one of the servants, who vanished and reappeared
moments later with a leatherbound folio. The maharana spoke briefly to Jadar,
then passed the book.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The maharana politely suggests that possibly your
English king's painters have not yet achieved the sophistication required for
Ragamala. He asks me to show you one of his personal albums.&quot; Jadar opened
the book and handed it to Hawksworth.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It was filled with vibrant miniature paintings, executed on
heavy sheets of paper that had been treated with a white pigment of rice water
and lavishly embellished with gold leaf. They showed round-eyed young women
with firm breasts and slender wrists lounging in beautifully stylized gardens
and courtyards, playing gilded instruments or sensuously embracing their
lovers, many surrounded by doves, peacocks, tame deer, and tapestry-covered
elephants. In some the blue-faced god Krishna played an instrument that looked
something like a sitar, to the wistful gaze of longing doe-eyed women whose
breasts swelled through their gauze wraps. The paintings imparted to Hawksworth
a curious world of emotional intensity: a celebration of life, love, and devotion.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Each Ragamala painting depicts the mood of a specific
raga.&quot; Jadar pointed to one of a jeweled woman feeding a peacock which
leaned down from a white marble rooftop, while her lover reached his arms to
encircle her. &quot;This is a raga named Hindol, a morning raga of love. The
Ragamala paintings of Mewar are a perfect blend of music, poetry, and pure
art.&quot; Jadar winked. &quot;After the maharana has painted you in your
native costume, perhaps he will have his artists paint you as the young god
Krishna, enticing some milkmaids to your leafy bed.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The maharana spoke again to Jadar.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;He asks whether these are anything like the paintings
your king's artists create for English ragas?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Tell him we don't have ragas in England. Our music is
different.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Jadar tried to mask his discomfort. &quot;Perhaps I should
merely say your English ragas are in a different style from those we have in
India. He will not be impressed to learn that English music is not yet advanced
enough to have developed the raga.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Jadar's reply seemed to satisfy the maharana. He turned and
said something to one of the men sitting near him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;His Highness has ordered that you be given an album of
Ragamala paintings to take back to your king, so the painters at his court may
try to copy them and begin to learn greatness.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;His Majesty, King James, will be deeply honored by the
rana's gift.&quot; Hawksworth bowed diplomatically, deciding not to inform the
maharana that King James had no painters and little taste.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The maharana beamed in satisfaction and dismissed Hawksworth
with a nod.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then the exchange of gifts began. Jadar produced a gold cloak
for the maharana, a jewel-encrusted sword, a jeweled saddle, and promised to
deliver an elephant with a silver howdah. The maharana in turn gave Jadar an
emerald the size of a large walnut, a gilded shield studded with jewels, and a
brace of jeweled katars. Each thanked the other extravagantly and set the
presents aside.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then Jadar suddenly stood up and began removing his turban.
The room fell silent at this unprecedented act.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Tonight, in gratitude for his friendship, for his offer
of an abode to one who no longer has any roof save a tent, I offer to His
Highness, the Maharana of Udaipur, my own turban, that he may have a lasting
token of my gratitude. That in the years ahead when, Allah willing, these dark
days are past, we will neither of us forget my indebtedness on this
night.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As Jadar stepped forward to present the turban, the
maharana's eyes flooded with emotion. Before Jadar had moved more than a pace,
Karan Singh was on his feet, ripping off his own turban. They met in the center
of the room, each reverently placing his own turban on the other's head, then
embracing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth looked around the room and saw Rajputs who would
gut an enemy without a blink now near to tears. He leaned back toward Shirin.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What's the significance of the turbans?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It's the rarest gift any man could present to another.
I've never before heard of a Moghul or a Rajput giving his turban. The story of
this will be told throughout Mewar. We have just seen the creation of a
legend.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then the maharana's voice rose. &quot;Mewar, the abode of all
that is beautiful in the world, is made even more beautiful by your presence.
In years past we have stood shield to shield with you; tonight we embrace you
in friendship. We wish you victory over those who would deny you your
birthright, which you have earned both by blood and by deed. No other in India
is more fit to reign, more just to govern, more honorable to his friends, more
feared by his foes. Tonight we offer you our hand and our prayers that Lord
Krishna will always stand with you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth turned to Shirin and whispered. &quot;What's he
saying?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Her eyes were dark. &quot;He's delaying his answer to the
prince. Offering him prayers to Lord Krishna. Prince Jadar doesn't need prayers
to Krishna. He needs Rajputs. Thousands of Rajputs. But perhaps in time the
maharana can be convinced. Banquets are not the place for negotiation. They're
the place for perfumed talk.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Jadar was smiling as though he had just been offered the
whole of Rajputana. He managed to thank the maharana lavishly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The maharana beamed and signaled for <i>pan </i>leaves again,
signifying the evening was ended. The room emptied in moments.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;I think Jadar could be in serious
trouble.&quot; Hawksworth turned to Shirin as they entered the hallway.
&quot;If he fails to get support here, what will he do?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I don't know. I think he may still manage an alliance
before he's through. But it will be costly. Otherwise he'll probably have to
move south and try to convince Malik Ambar to commit him his Maratha army. But
Rajputs are better.&quot; She moved closer. &quot;I'm suddenly so very, very
tired of armies and tents and strategies. I don't know where it will end. Time
is running out. For him and for us.&quot; She brushed him lightly with her body.
&quot;Will you make love to me tonight as though we'd never heard of Rajputs
and Marathas? We'll look at the lake in the moonlight and forget everything,
just for tonight.&quot; She opened her hand. Inside were several small brown
balls. &quot;I took some of the maharana's <i>affion</i>. Tonight we have no
battles to fight.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>                                          *</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth sat beside Shirin watching the oarsmen strain
against the locks, their orange oars flashing against the ornately gilded boat
like the immense gills of some ceremonial fish. A turbaned drummer sat at one
end, sounding the beat, and the tillerman stood behind him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>They were headed for Jagmandir Island, on the invitation of
Prince Jadar, in a boat provided by Maharana Karan Singh. Three weeks of
banquets, hunting, and oaths of lasting friendship seemed to have done little
to <i>Resolve</i> the question of the maharana's support for Jadar's rebellion.
Time, Hawksworth told himself, is starting to work heavily against the prince.
The Imperial army let us escape because they were too shattered to attack
again. But we all know they're rebuilding. Jadar has to decide soon how much
longer he can afford to stay here and listen to vague promises.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Behind them the high walls and turrets of the maharana's
palace towered above the cliff, reflecting gold in the late afternoon sun. As
they neared the island, Hawksworth turned back to see the thick stone walls of
the city following the curve of the surrounding hilltops and finally angling
down to a tall watchtower at the very edge of the lake. He realized the lake
itself was actually the city's fourth defense barrier.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Ahead, the white sandstone palace on Jagmandir glistened
against the water. At the front a large pavilion surrounded by delicate white
pillars jutted out into the lake. Its entrance was guarded by a row of
life-sized stone elephants rising out of the water, their trunks raised above
their heads in silent salute. As their boat neared the arched entryway of the
pavilion, Hawksworth saw a veiled woman surrounded by eunuchs standing on the
marble-paved dock to greet them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It's Her Highness, Princess Mumtaz.&quot; Shirin's
voice was suddenly flooded with surprised delight. Then she turned to
Hawksworth with a laugh. &quot;Welcome to the <i>zenana</i>, Ambassador.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;What's she doing here?&quot; Hawksworth
examined the figure, whose jewels glistened in the afternoon sun, then warily
studied the eunuchs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;She's come to meet us.&quot; Shirin's voice was lilting
in anticipation. &quot;I think she's bored to frustration trapped on this
island prison.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As their boat touched the dock, Mumtaz moved forward and
immediately embraced Shirin. Her eyes swept Hawksworth as he bowed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Your Highness.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Mumtaz giggled behind her veil and turned to Shirin, speaking
in Persian. &quot;Do we have to speak barbarous Turki because of him?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Just for this afternoon.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I welcome you in the name of His Highness.&quot;
Mumtaz's Turki was accented but otherwise flawless. &quot;He asked me to meet
you and show you the garden and the palace.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She began chattering to Shirin in a mixture of Persian and
Turki as they walked into the garden. It soon revealed itself to be a matrix of
bubbling fountains and geometrical stone walkways, beside which rows of
brightly colored flowers bloomed. Ahead of them the small three-story palace
rose skyward like a long-stemmed lotus, its top a high dome with a sensuous
curve. The ground floor was an open arcade, with light interior columns and a
row of connecting quarters off each side for women and servants, screened
behind marble grillwork.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Mumtaz directed them on through the garden and into the cool
arcade of the palace. At one side, near the back, a stone stairway spiraled
upward to the second floor. Mumtaz led the way, motioning them to follow.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>At the second floor they emerged into a small chamber strewn
with bolsters and carpets that seemed to be Jadar's reception room. Mumtaz
ignored it as she started up the next circular staircase.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The topmost room was tiny, dazzling white, completely
unfurnished. The ornate marble cupola of the dome towered some thirty feet
above their heads, and around the sides were carved niches decorated with
colored stone. Light beamed through the room from a wide doorway leading to a
balcony, which was also bare save for an ornately carved sitar leaned against
its railing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;His Highness has taken a particular fondness
for this room and refuses to allow anything to be placed in it. He sits here
for hours, and on the balcony there, doing I don't know what.&quot; Mumtaz
gestured toward the doorway. &quot;He wanted me to bring you here to wait for
him.&quot; She sighed. &quot;I agree with him that this room brings a great
feeling of peace. But what good is peace that cannot last? I don't know how
much longer we can stay here.&quot; Mumtaz turned and hugged Shirin again.
&quot;I so miss Agra. And the Jamuna. Sometimes I wonder if we'll ever see it
again.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Shirin stroked Mumtaz's dark hair, then said something to her
in Persian. Mumtaz smiled and turned to Hawksworth.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Do you really love her?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;More than anything.&quot; Hawksworth was momentarily
startled by her directness.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then take her with you. Away from here. Away from all
the killing and death. How much longer can any of us endure it?&quot; Her hard
eyes blinked away a hint of a tear. &quot;I've lived most of my life with His
Highness in tents, bearing children. I'm so weary of it all. And now I wonder
if we'll ever have a place just for ourselves.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She would have continued, but footsteps sounded on the stone
stairs, and Jadar emerged beaming from the stairwell, his turban set rakishly
on the side of his head. He seemed in buoyant spirits. &quot;You're here! Let
me welcome you and offer you something to banish the afternoon heat.&quot; He
gave Mumtaz a quick hug. Hawksworth sensed this was not the official Jadar.
This was a prince very much at his ease. &quot;I hope Shirin will join me in
having some <i>sharbat</i>. But for you, Captain, I've had a surprise prepared.
I think you might even like it better than your foul brandy.&quot; He spoke
quickly to a eunuch waiting at the top of the stairs, then turned back to
Hawksworth and Shirin. &quot;Have you found the maharana's palace to your
liking?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;His view of the lake and the mountains is the finest in
India.&quot; Shirin performed a <i>teslim</i>. &quot;We so thank Your
Highness.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Mumtaz embraced Shirin once more, said something to her in
Persian, then bowed to Jadar and disappeared down the stairwell. He watched her
tenderly until she was gone before he turned back to Hawksworth and Shirin.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Come outside with me.&quot; He walked past them through
the marble doorway. &quot;Have you seen the lake yet from the balcony? This one
afternoon we will drink together and watch the sunset. Before we all leave
Udaipur I wanted you to see this place. It's become very special for me. When I
sit here in the cool afternoon, I seem to forget all the wounds I've ever felt
in battle. For a moment nothing else exists.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I think this palace is almost finer than the one Rana
Karan Singh has.&quot; Hawksworth stroked Shirin's thigh as they followed Jadar
onto the cool balcony, impulsively wanting her in his arms. Then he cleared his
throat. &quot;I don't remember ever seeing anything quite like it in
India.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;At times you can be a perceptive man, Captain.
Allah may have showed his wisdom when he sent you here.&quot; Jadar smiled.
&quot;You know, I still remember my first word of your arrival, and your
now-famous encounter with the Portuguese. I think that morning will someday
change the history of both our lands—the morning India and England met.&quot;
He looked pensively down into the garden below. &quot;It all depends on what
happens next.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What do you think will happen, Highness?&quot; Shirin
moved next to Jadar at the edge of the balcony.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He squinted into the waning sun for a moment, then turned his
eyes away. &quot;It's difficult to know. Probably the Imperial army will be
sent against me again, any day now.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Will the maharana support you with his cavalry?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Jadar fell silent, as though choosing his words carefully.
Then he shrugged away discretion. &quot;I think he might, but I still don't
know. I hear that many of the other ranas of Rajputana have warned him not to
side with me openly. They still remember the devastation Inayat Latif wrought
here fifteen years ago, when he was sent by Arangbar to put down their
rebellion. Rajputs love to battle, but not amid their own cities and fields.
And that's easy to understand. Rana Karan Singh is in a difficult position. He
knows if I stand here and fight, the battle could well destroy Udaipur.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What will you do?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'll probably have to move out soon, and move quickly,
farther north into the mountains or back south to Burhanpur. I can't stand and
fight again, not yet. That's one of the reasons I sent for you.&quot; He turned
to face Hawksworth. &quot;I think it's time you left India. No one in Agra
except Nadir Sharif knows you're alive. But it's obvious you can't return
there, not under the present circumstances. It's probably best that you return
to England, at least until my fortunes are <i>Resolve</i>d. You must not join
me in any more battles. It's not your war.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth felt a sudden chill against his skin.
&quot;There's no reason for me to leave. And besides, I have no way to return
to England now. The Company is supposed to send a voyage this autumn, but . .
.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;There's always a way to do anything, Captain.&quot;
Jadar stopped and laughed. &quot;Well, almost anything. Here at Udaipur you're
only a few days' ride south to our port of Cambay. Like Surat, it's still free
of Portuguese control. I may have very few friends left in Agra, but I do have
friends in Cambay. I can arrange for your passage on an Indian trader as far as
the Moluccas, where you can doubtless hail a Dutch fleet. You can leave India
secretly and safely. No one in Agra need ever know you helped me.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I am not sure I want to leave now.&quot; Hawksworth
slipped his arm around Shirin's waist.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Jadar looked at him and smiled. &quot;But Shirin has to leave
with you. Her life is no safer here now than yours.&quot; He fixed them both
squarely. &quot;I hereby command her to accompany you. You can both return to
India someday . . . if Allah is kind and I succeed. And you'll be first among
all my ambassadors, Captain, I promise you. You'll receive my first <i>firman </i>for
trade. But if I die in the days to come, your English king will not be accused
someday of aiding a renegade. I hereby order you both to leave, tomorrow.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I don't run from a fight. There's some sea dog left in
me.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I know you don't, Captain, and that's one of the things
I like most about you. But I'm sending you away, ordering you to go. I'll
always remember it was against your will.&quot; Jadar looked up to see a eunuch
entering with a tray of cups. &quot;Now for your drink. I ordered my kitchen to
make <i>panch </i>for you—I understand the <i>topiwallahs </i>in Surat think
it's called 'punch.'&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Punch? What is it?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;An Indian delicacy. A special blend of wine, water,
sugar, lemons, and spices. Five ingredients. Actually, <i>panch </i>is just the
Hindi word for five.' Try it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth tasted the perfumed red mixture, slices of lemon
rind floating on its surface. It was so delicious he almost drank it off at one
gulp. Jadar watched him, smiling, then lifted a cup of <i>sharbat </i>from the
tray and gestured the eunuch toward Shirin. &quot;I gather you find it
acceptable.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It's perfect to watch a sunset with.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I thought you'd like it. You know, Captain, I've rather
enjoyed seeing you grow to understand and love India. That's rare among <i>feringhi</i>.
That's why I absolutely insist your king send you back as his next
ambassador.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Nothing would please me more.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;I think you mean it. And I want you to believe
me when I tell you that nothing would please me more. Together we'll rid India
of the Portuguese scourge forever.&quot; Jadar lifted his cap in a toast and Hawksworth
joined him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And here's to ridding India of one Portuguese in
particular.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Jadar paused. &quot;Who do you mean?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The Viceroy, Miguel Vaijantes. I don't think I ever
told you he murdered my father in Goa, many years ago.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Jadar listened in silence. &quot;I had no idea.&quot; Then
his eyes grew grim. &quot;I know him all too well. You may or may not be aware
he was once planning to arm Malik Ambar against me. Unfortunately there's very
little I can do about him just now. But I have a long memory too, and someday,
Allah willing, I'll put an end to his trade. Will that be justice enough for us
both?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'll drink to it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And I'll drink with you.&quot; Jadar took a deep
swallow of <i>sharbat</i>. &quot;To England and India. And now, for the other
reason I asked you both here today. To see what you think about something. It's
curious, but living here in this little palace, I've found myself growing
obsessed by an idea. I'd like to know if you think it's mad.&quot; He drank
again, then signaled the waiting eunuch to refill their cups. &quot;If I become
Moghul one day, I've decided to build something very special for Mumtaz, a work
of beauty unlike anything India has ever seen. Staying here on Jagmandir Island
has given me the idea. But first come inside and let me show you
something.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Jadar rose and strolled back through the columned doorway
into the domed room. &quot;Did you happen to notice this when you came
in?&quot; He pointed to one of the two-foot- high niches in the curved walls.
Hawksworth realized that each niche was decorated around its top and sides with
inlays of semi-precious stones set into the marble. Each inlay was a painting
of a different flower.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;Do you see what he's done here?&quot; Jadar
motioned Hawksworth and Shirin closer. &quot;This is far more than merely a
design. It's actually a painting in rare, colored stone—onyx, carnelian,
jasper, agate.&quot; Jadar paused. &quot;Think carefully. Have either of you
ever seen anything like this in Agra?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I've never seen anything like it before,
anywhere.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Of course you haven't. This is unique. It's truly
astonishing. Here on Jagmandir Island, with the design of this room, Rana Karan
Singh has actually invented a new style of art. It's phenomenal. Now look
up.&quot; Jadar pointed to the cupola ceiling. &quot;Notice the sensuous curve
of the dome. Like a bud just before it bursts into flower. And at the top you
see more inlays of precious stone. I think it's the most magnificent thing I've
ever seen. Its shape and color and purity move me almost to tears.&quot; He
paused and looked at Hawksworth mischievously. &quot;So can you guess what I've
decided to do someday?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Build a room like this in Agra?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Jadar exploded with laughter. &quot;But this room is so
small! What sort of gift would that be for Mumtaz? No, Captain, if I should
eventually find myself ruling India, I've decided to build Mumtaz an entire
palace like this, a Mahal, all of white marble and inlay. I'll surround it with
a garden larger and more beautiful than anything India has ever seen. It will
be a place of love and of mystery, with the strength of a Rajput warrior in the
harsh sunshine, the warmth of a Persian woman in the moonlight. The outside
will be covered with verses from the Quran carved in marble, and inside the
walls will be a garden of jeweled flowers. Minarets will rise at each corner,
calling all India to prayer, and its dome will be a cupola with the subtle,
sensuous curve of a ripening bud. It will be immense, the most magnificent
Mahal in the world. And it will be my gift to her.&quot; He paused, his eyes
glowing. &quot;Is the idea completely insane?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It's beautiful.&quot; Shirin was beaming.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I think it's magnificent.&quot; Jadar seemed not to
need encouragement, as he drank again from his <i>sharbat</i>. &quot;So now you
know the other reason I invited you here this afternoon. To tell you what you
may see when you return to Agra. I haven't decided on the exact location yet,
but it will be on the bank of the Jamuna, placed so Mumtaz can watch the sun
set over the water, just as we do here. I wanted to tell you both, for I sense
you two are among the few who could really appreciate what a bold idea this
is.&quot; Jadar looked sharply at Shirin. &quot;Now, you must never, never tell
Mumtaz, whatever else you two Persians may chatter on about. For now let's keep
it a secret among us. But someday, someday it will tell all the world how much
I love her.&quot; He sighed. &quot;You know, at times I worry I'm nothing more
than a romantic Persian myself, deep inside.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He looked about the glistening walls once more, then
reluctantly turned and walked out onto the balcony again.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The peace I feel here overwhelms me sometimes. It quiets
all the unrest in my soul. Perhaps I'm a fool to ever think of Agra. But Agra
is my destiny. The Hindus would say it's my <i>dharma</i>.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>He stopped to watch as Mumtaz and her women emerged
from their quarters and gathered around the fountain in the garden below. The
evening air was flooded with the women's rose attar and musk perfume. He
inhaled deeply, then turned to Hawksworth.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;By the way, I've had a small farewell gift made for
you, Captain. It's there beside you.&quot; He pointed to the sitar by the
railing. &quot;I understand you've started learning to play it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth turned, startled, and picked up the instrument.
Its workmanship was fine art, with ivory inlays along both sides of the body
and a neck carved as the head of a swan. He found himself stunned. &quot;I've
only just begun to learn, Highness. This is much finer than I deserve. It's
worthy of an Ustad.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then perhaps it will inspire you to become a Master
yourself someday.&quot; He laughed. &quot;And now I want to hear how you play
it. The Hindus believe the sitar is a window to the soul. That the sound of the
first note tells everything there is to know about a man. I want to see if
you've actually understood anything since you've been here. What raga have you
been studying?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Malkauns.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;An ambitious choice. I seem to remember that's a
devotional raga. For late evening. But the sun's almost down. We'll pretend
it's the moon, just rising. Let's go inside, where you can sit.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hawksworth carried the sitar and followed numbly as Jadar led
the way back into the tiny marble room. The apprehension he had momentarily
felt on the balcony seemed to dissolve among the bouquets of precious stones in
the inlaid walls. He slipped off his shoes and seated himself in the middle of
the room. Then he quickly tested the tuning on the strings, both the upper and
the lower. He could already tell the sound it produced was magnificent, with
the resonance of an organ. Jadar and Shirin seated themselves opposite,
speaking Persian in low voices as they watched him cradle the round body of the
sitar in the curved instep of his left foot. Then they both fell expectantly
silent.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He knew what they were waiting to hear. For the raga
Malkauns, a master would sound the first note powerfully, yet with a sense of
great subtlety—slipping his finger quickly down the string and into the note
just as it was struck, then instantly pulling the string across the fret,
almost in the same motion, again raising the pitch and giving the feeling the
note had merely been tasted, dipped down into and out again as it quavered into
existence. But it was much more than mere technique. That was the easiest part.
It was a sense. A feeling. It came not from the hand, but from the heart. The
note must be felt, not merely sounded. When done with lightness, life seemed to
be created, a <i>prahna </i>in the music that the player and listener shared as
one. But if the player's heart was false, regardless of how skilled he might
be, then his music was hollow and dead.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He breathed deeply, trying to clear his mind, then slipped
the wire plectrum over his finger and gently stroked the lower sympathetic
strings once, twice, to establish the mood. The cool air was crisp and
flower-scented, and the sound rose gently upward toward the marble cupola above
them. As he listened he found himself looking at Shirin and Jadar, their dark
eyes, delicate faces. Then his eyes moved beyond them, to the garden of inlaid
stones in the marble walls. And for a moment he felt something he had never
felt before. This was the India he had, until that moment, only been in. But
here, now, he was finally part of it. He took another deep breath and struck.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The first note was perfect, encompassing. He felt it. He knew
it. He sensed his hand merge with the music, the music with his own life.
Shirin's eyes seemed to melt, and Jadar immediately swung his head from side to
side in approval. Then he began to alap, the virtuoso first section of the
raga, meant to be played solo and without drum accompaniment. He felt the music
slowly growing around him as he found and explored note after note of the
raga's structure. He found himself wanting to taste and feel each note to its
essence, reluctant to move on to the next. But each time he was beckoned
forward, until at last nothing but the music mattered. He played on and on, the
intensity of the alap growing organically, almost of its own self, until it
burst to completion, like a flower that had gloriously escaped the entrapment
of its bud.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>When the final note died into silence, Shirin slowly rose and
slipped her arms around his neck. Jadar sat motionless for a moment longer,
then reached out and put his hand on the strings of the sitar.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You have earned it, Captain. I've heard what I'd hoped
to hear. Your music tells me all I want to know about you.&quot; He rose and
led them back out onto the balcony. &quot;I know now you can understand why I
also want to create something of beauty someday. A Mahal that will last as long
as this music. If we cannot taste love and beauty, our hearts are dead.&quot;
He smiled at Hawksworth. &quot;There is love in your music, Captain. Your heart
is as it should be. And in the end, nothing else really matters. Nothing
else.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He turned and stared pensively into the twilight. &quot;My
Mahal will have it too. Because it is in my own heart.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Jadar stopped abruptly and gazed toward the darkening shore.
Through the dimming light a boat could be seen approaching, rowed furiously by
lines of red-cloaked oarsmen. Sitting in the center on a gilded platform was
Maharana Karan Singh, wearing full battle dress. His powerful bow hung loosely from
his leather quiver and his rhino-hide shield rested at his side. Jadar studied
the boat for a moment and concern gathered in his eyes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;He would never come here unannounced. Merciful</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Allah, has
the Imperial army moved against us already? How can it be so soon? My
preparations have scarcely begun.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Jadar watched as the maharana leaped from the boat almost
before it touched the marble dock. The women around Mumtaz fled the courtyard,
and now the eunuchs pressed forward to bow and welcome him. He brushed them
aside as he moved quickly through the garden and into the lower arcade of the
palace. Jadar stood listening expectantly to the quick pad of his footsteps on
the stone stairs, then walked inside to greet him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Nimaste, my friend. You've already missed the best part
of the sunset, but I'll have more <i>sharbat </i>sent.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The maharana glanced in surprise at Hawksworth and Shirin for
a second, then turned and bowed quickly to Jadar.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The news is very bad, Highness.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then we'll sweeten it with <i>sharbat</i>.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;There is no time, Highness.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;There's always time for <i>sharbat</i>. This has been a
special afternoon for me.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Highness, I came to tell you Arangbar is dead. The
Moghul of India joined the immortals two days ago.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Jadar examined him a moment almost as though not comprehending.
Then he turned and stared out through the balcony doorway, past Hawksworth and
Shirin. &quot;I would not have wished it. I sincerely would not have wished
it.&quot; He turned back to Karan Singh. &quot;How did he die? Did Janahara
murder my father, as she's killed so many others?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;No, Highness. It almost seems as though he deemed it
his time to die. Two weeks ago he was hunting and saw a beater stumble and fall
over a ledge, killing himself. His Majesty grew despondent, saying he had
caused the man's death. Next he began to declare it an omen of his own death.
He refused food and drink. Finally even the physicians despaired. He died in
his bed. Word was given out that he was still hunting, so the news was
carefully kept from all of Agra until the very end.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;How did you learn?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Nadir Sharif sent runners. He dared not send a
pigeon.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Jadar walked out onto the balcony and peered down into the
darkened garden. After a long moment he spoke. &quot;Allah. Then it's
finished.&quot; He turned back to the Rajput. &quot;Has Janahara declared
Allaudin Moghul yet?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;She has announced she will do so, Highness.&quot; Karan
Singh moved out onto the balcony next to Jadar, hesitant to interrupt his
thoughts. The cries of water birds flooded the evening air around them. Jadar
studied the garden again, as though lost in some distant reverie. When he spoke
his voice seemed to emanate from a bottomless void.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Allaudin will be in the Red Fort. It can never be
taken, not even with a hundred thousand Rajputs. He will never come to face me.
He will never need to.&quot; He turned slowly to Karan Singh. &quot;I've lost
it all, my friend. And I've brought ignominy to your lands by my presence as
your guest. For that I am truly sorry.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Karan Singh stared at Jadar. &quot;But Highness, Allaudin may
not yet be in Agra. You know he wanted Queen Janahara to appoint him to command
the army sent against you. Naturally she refused and instead convinced Arangbar
to appoint him commander of the forces to be sent against the Persian Safavis
threatening the northwest fortress of Qandahar. It was obvious to everyone
except Allaudin that she meant it to be merely a ceremonial appointment, an
excuse to elevate his <i>mansab </i>rank to equal yours. She had carefully
arranged to have him detained in Agra. But he decided on his own that he would
actually go north, to prove himself a commander. Just before the hunting
accident, he persuaded Arangbar to allow him to march. Arangbar was apparently
drunk on wine and approved the order before Janahara discovered it. Allaudin
departed Agra a week ago with twenty thousand men and a huge train of
courtiers. Because of their numbers, it's thought he has traveled very slowly.
But Nadir Sharif said as of the day before yesterday he still had not returned
to Agra. No one knows for sure how near he may actually be.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And where are Inayat Latif and the Imperial army?&quot;
Jadar's voice quickened.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Of that we're not yet certain, Highness. They may be in</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Agra by now,
holding the Red Fort for Allaudin, but we have no way to know.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Jadar turned and seized his arm. &quot;Then I will ride.
Tonight. Have you told my men?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Two thousand of my men are now in their saddles
waiting, Highness. By sunup another twenty thousand will be ready to
ride.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Jadar stared at him for a moment, then reached out and
touched the turban the Rajput was wearing. Hawksworth realized it was Jadar's
gift.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then give me three of your best horses. Tonight. I will
rotate as I ride.&quot; Jadar turned and ordered a waiting eunuch to bring his
riding cloak, his sword, and his katar.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I will be riding with you too, Highness.&quot; Karan
Singh stepped forward.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>This time Jadar embraced Karan Singh for a long moment. Then
he pulled back. &quot;No. I will not allow it. If I am too late—and the odds
are strong against me—no one who rides with me will leave Agra alive. No, my
friend, this I forbid.&quot; Jadar silenced Karan Singh's gesture of protest.
&quot;Your offer is enough. I want my good friends alive.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Jadar started for the stairs, then paused and turned back to
look one last time at Hawksworth and Shirin.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;So our farewell was more timely than we knew. I regret
we did not have longer.&quot; He paused to take his riding cloak from the
eunuch. Then he reached for Hawksworth's hand. &quot;Remember me, my friend.
And remember the Mahal. I've told no one else. If I'm still alive when you come
again to Agra, I'll take you there. If I'm dead, remember what I dreamed.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He turned and disappeared down the stairwell.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>A tear stained Shirin's cheek as she watched him move across
the courtyard below. When he reached Mumtaz, anxiously waiting by the dock, he
paused and said something to her, then embraced her closely. As he pulled away,
she reached out to stop him. But he was already joining the maharana in the
boat. In moments they were swallowed in the dusk.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;None of us will ever see him again. You know
it's true.&quot; Shirin's voice was strangely quiet. &quot;What does it matter
where Allaudin is? Prince Jadar can never challenge the troops Janahara will
have holding the Red Fort. Not with two thousand Rajputs, not with two hundred
thousand Rajputs. It's impregnable. He'll never see the inside of the Red Fort
again.&quot; She moved next to him and rested her head against his chest.
&quot;Will you help me remember him from tonight. And the Mahal he will never
live to build?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

premised, etc. and expecting your Worship's favorable perusing of this letter.
May it please God, the <i>Discovery</i> will be fully laded within the month
and ready to sail. In the meanwhile I forward this letter by Capt. Otterinck of
the Spiegel, bound this day for Amsterdam, to advise you of certain New
Conditions affecting the Company's trade. I have inform'd you by earlier letter
of our Entertainment provided the Portugals in the Surat Bay, with the two of
their vessels set to fire, by which they were all consumed and between four and
five hundred men slain, burnt, and drowned, and of ours (God be praised) only
two and some few hurt, with all Commodity safe. I have reported also the loss
of the <i>Resolve</i> at Surat by lamentable Circumstance. Yet I maintain great
Hope that we are like to discover profitable Trade with the Country of India.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>I write now
to advise you the Hollanders have late brought News of a new King of that
Country. Reports have reached the Moluccas that the Moghul Arangbar died
suddenly some two months past, to be succeeded by one of his Sons, whose
Pleasure toward England is uncertain. The full Events are not clearly known
here, but this will doubtless require our new Petition for license to trade.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>As is oft
the way in Heathen lands, the story of the Son's succession is a marvelous
convoluted Tale. There were said to be two Sons in contention, belike both
Knaves, and the Hollanders have deduced that the late Arangbar's Queen, named
Janahara, favor'd one Son over the other, for reasons known best to her Self,
and intrigued in his succession. They have concluded thus because the new
Moghul is said to have promptly rewarded her with a large secluded Estate of
her own outside of Agra, with his personal Guards to protect her, something the
Dutchmen claim has never before been done for a Moorish Queen in India. The
Hollanders further deduce that this Queen effected the favored Son's succession
through her Prime Minister, a subtle Rogue called Sharif, who, when the Moghul
Arangbar died, secretly arranged the Assassination of the other Son before he
could reach Agra and make his own claim for the Throne. This said Sharif was
again appointed Prime Minister by the new Moghul, doubtless a Reward for his
cunning Service.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>So it is His
Majesty King James may now desire to dispatch another Ambassador to Agra, to
petition this new Moghul to grant English trade. If a Petition is to be sent,
know that before taking the Throne this Son was called by the name Prince
Jadar, though doubtless he is now to be addressed formally as The Moghul.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>I have as
yet been unable to discover whether the Mission of Capt. Hawksworth to Agra,
authorized by Your Worship in your Wisdom, met success. (Though his Mission
will no longer assist the Company in any instance, since he would not be known
to this new Moghul, Jadar.) However, the Hollanders have advised that an
English seaman named Hawksworth was taken from an Indian vessel off Malabar one
month past, in company with a Moorish woman, by a Frigate of theirs that later
was caught by a Storm off the same Malabar Coast. Her mainmast split in that
Storm, and the vessel was lost sight of soon after, leaving the Hollanders to
lament it may have sunk or gone aground on the Coast, together with over five
hundred ton of their Malabar pepper. If this was our former Captain-General, he
is either gone to God or is now again in India (if the vessel haply made
landfall and saved the Hollanders' pepper).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>In closing
(for the Dutchmen advise they are preparing to hoist sail), I am content to
report that Indian commodity is readily vendable at the port of Bantam,
particularly fine calicoes and indigo, and I adjudge the Company would be well
advis'd to dispatch a new Voyage to Surat upon receipt of this letter. The
Monopoly of the Portugals holds no more, esp. after their Humiliation in the
late engagement off Surat. On condition the Company post a Gentleman of Quality
to Agra (One less susceptable to Moorish ways than Capt. Hawksworth, and
therefore, in my Judgement, like to be better respected by the new Moghul) our
Subscribers stand to enjoy great Profit in the Company's Indies trade.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>For those
curious how much of the foregoing tale is &quot;true,&quot; perhaps it may be
helpful to unmask the original inspiration for several of the characters. The
Great Moghul Akman, his son Arangbar, and Arangbar's primary consort, Queen
Janahara, had real-life counterparts in the Great Moghul Akbar, his successor
Jahangir, and Jahangir's resourceful Persian queen, Nur Jahan. Nadir Sharif,
for all his duplicity, had nothing on Jahangir's devious prime minister, Asaf
Khan, the brother of Queen Nur Jahan. Similarly, Prince Jadar was no more
ingenious, and no less wronged, than Asaf Khan's son-in-law, the subsequent
Moghul and builder of the Taj Mahal, Shah Jahan. Prince Jadar's strategies and
intrigues, first with and then against Queen Janahara, resemble in many ways
those of Shah Jahan as he struggled to thwart the ambitions of Nur Jahan. The
Shahbandar and the opium-sotted governor of Surat also had counterparts in real
individuals, as did Jadar's beloved Mumtaz, his younger brother Prince
Allaudin, Princess Layla, Malik Ambar, and Inayat Latif. The Sufi mystic Samad
was re-created from the real-life poet Sarmad, who was admired by Shah Jahan
and who was executed by a later Moghul for precisely the reasons given in the
story. Of the Portuguese, Father Alvarez Sarmento was drawn in some part from
the learned Father Jerome Xavier. It should be noted that the unofficial
actions of the early Jesuits in India are remembered today primarily through
the perceptions of English travelers, all of whom were all staunchly
anti-Catholic. The role of Portuguese Jesuits in the preceding story was
faithful in spirit to the English reports, although today these may seem mildly
paranoid in their fear and suspicion.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Of the
English characters, only Huyghen and Roger Symmes are beholden to single,
recognizable individuals: being Jan van Linschoten and Ralph Fitch,
respectively. Brian Hawksworth is largely a fictional composite, whose
experiences recall in part those of William Hawkins (in India from 1608 to
1613) and in part those of other seventeenth-century European adventurers. His
defeat of the four Portuguese galleons was only a slight dramatization of
historic victories by severely outnumbered English frigates off Surat in 1612
and 1614 commanded by English captains Thomas Best and Nicholas Downton, both sailing
for the early East India Company. Hawksworth's mercurial relationship with the
Moghul and his experiences at the Moghul’s court were re-created in part from
the letters and diaries of William Hawkins and those of his successor, Sir
Thomas Roe. As did Brian Hawksworth, William Hawkins adopted the Indian style
of life in dress and diet, much to the astonishment of his European
contemporaries. Brian Hawksworth's love affair with Shirin was suggested by
William Hawkins' marriage to an Indian women of noble descent, possibly a
member of the Moghul’s court, on the encouragement of Jahangir, who suspected
the Jesuits of attempting to poison him and wanted his food monitored. Hawkins'
wife later journeyed to London, where she caused the East India Company considerable
disruption over their responsibilities toward her, and eventually she returned
to India.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Although most of the early Englishmen in India resembled our
George Elkington far more than they did Brian Hawksworth, there was one early
traveler, Thomas Coryat, whose cultural and human sensibilities would not have
clashed greatly with those of Brian Hawksworth at the end of his story.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The sudden appearance of the bubonic plague in India was
taken from the court history of the Moghul Jahangir. Similarly, the capture of
the Moghul’s trading vessel by the Portuguese, intended to intimidate him and
forestall an English trade agreement, and his retaliatory closure of Jesuit
missions happened essentially as described. The Jesuits were allowed to reopen
their missions a few years later, but the damage was done. There seems evidence
that the Portuguese did conspire to assist the forces opposing the succession
of Shah Jahan, whom they justifiably feared. The rebellion of Shah Jahan
extended over several years, and did include at one point a stay on the Udaipur
island of Jagmandir, where some historians now believe he first saw inlay work
of the type that later became a distinguishing feature of his crowning
creation, the Taj Mahal.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>For those who may wish to gain more familiarity with Moghul
India, various sources can be recommended. Lively historical works on the
Moghul period include Waldemar Hansen's classic panorama The Peacock Throne and
the even more recent Cities of Mughul India by Gavin Hambly, to mention two of
my favorites. For those still more curious, and adventurous, there are the
original writings from the seventeenth century, which will require more digging
but are decidedly worth the effort. Readers with access to a major library may
be able to find reprinted editions of the diaries of several
seventeenth-century English and European travelers in India. These are the
works, with their trenchant firsthand accounts, that all students of the era
find indispensable. Perhaps the most easily obtainable is a collection entitled
Early Travels in India, William Foster, ed., which contains edited versions of
the diaries of William Hawkins and several others. Following this, the most
thorough account of England's early diplomacy in India is contained in the
diary entitled The Embassy of Sir Thomas Roe (1615-1619), written by England's
first real ambassador to India. Many subsequent diaries and letters of
seventeenth-century European travelers have been reprinted by the Hakluyt
Society, whose publications comprise a virtual bibliography of the era.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The most relevant Indian writings, also obtainable in English
translation from a fine library, are the memoirs of the Great Moghul Jahangir,
entitled the Tuzuk-i-Jahangiri, and an encyclopedic description of court life
in late sixteenth-century India entitled the Ain-i-Akbari, set down by Akbar's
chief adviser and close friend, Abul Fazl.</span></p>

be indebted far beyond his ability to acknowledge adequately. The scholar who
provided the greatest assistance was Professor John Richards of the Duke

might prefer it be spelled Mughal) India, who graciously consented to review
the manuscript in draft and offered many corrections of fact and
interpretation. He is, of course, in no way accountable for any liberties that
may have remained. Thanks are similarly due Professor Gerald Berreman of the
University of California at Berkeley, a knowledgeable authority on Indian caste
practices, who agreed to review the relevant portions of the manuscript. I am
also indebted to Waldemar Hansen, who generously provided me with the
voluminous notes accumulated for his own history, The Peacock Throne.
Historians in India who gave warmly of their time and advice include Dr. Romila
Thapar, Professor P. M. Joshi, and Father John Correia-Alfonso, the preeminent
Jesuit authority on the early Moghul era and a scholar whose characteristic
integrity and generosity roundly revise the period depiction of his order in
the story.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

the Archaeological Survey of India, for special permission to study the
now-restricted <i>zenana </i>quarters beneath the Red Fort in Agra; to Nawab
Mir Sultan Alam Khan of Surat, for assistance in locating obscure historical
sites in that city; to Indrani Rehman, the grande dame of Indian classical
dance, for information on the now-abolished <i>devadasi </i>caste; to Ustad
Vilayat Khan, one of Indian's great sitar masters, for discussions concerning
his art; and to my many Indian friends in New York, New Delhi, and Bombay.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>I am also obliged to Miss Betty Tyres of the Indian
Department of the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, who kindly provided
access to the museum's extensive archives of Indian miniature paintings, and to
the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich for information on early English
